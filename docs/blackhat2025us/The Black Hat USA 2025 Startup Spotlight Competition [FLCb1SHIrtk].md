Oh okay I'm already Mike fantastic well welcome good afternoon everybody so you know today we're gonna to look at some fantastic companies。

 you know one of the things in looking at this day and age and some of the finalists and the companies that entered this competition the one thing that really struck me was that we are in a really amazing time right now where you're seeing this radical shift where we are able to take software that used to be what I'd call sort of dumb and turn it into really smart software and the ability of what I used to think are things that were unsolvable problems in security are now being solved in a little less than a year to two years times by amazing and innovative companies and founders like we're going to see today but before we get to that we have to go to the introduction of our esteemed panel of judges so we have a lot of them and what's fantastic about this。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_41.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_42.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_44.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_45.png)

I when you look at their backgrounds as I go through very short parts of their background is they come from very diverse sets of backgrounds and what's amazing about that is that as finalists and whoever the winner is they're going to have to be very wellrounded it's not just as this applied to the buyer it's not just as this apply to the investor this has to apply across the board and very many facets and so they're going to be a very very hard judges to be able to pass what they've got so let me start with Colleen Coulett she was the exciso at Twilio and segment she builds security cultures that stick and also for me I can tell you when I was a CO she was a person that I personally would get advice for on how to do my job phenomenal Cso next is Trarey Fort for those of you who are familiar with black hatt you'll know his face he was the GM at black hat here for quite some time he also。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_47.png)

Secured sales forcece now is the ceso at bug crowd knows attackers and defenders like the back of his hand we've got holy Heesy。

Principal analyst at Odia tracks threats across IoT landscape， understands the market at scale。

 understands the patterns and trends that apply we've got Matthew Martin who's a 25 year security leader now CEO of a company called two Candsticks advises on AI driven risk Matthew you're as old as I am in this industry welcome to this Brook Mata X rapidd7 bug crowdd now CEO and also by the way previous winner I believe of the black black hat startup spotlight Lucas Nelson。

 also a very good friend of mine VC partner hacker turned investor。

 he is one of the few VCs that I think that you'll find that was the technical hacker knows this industry backwards and forwards and now is the person that decides where the money goes so whatever he invests in you should just try to invest in as well。

😀Yeah。😊，Robert Stratton also a GP Ma 37 early， also very similar knows this space IDS pioneer and longtime startup mentor one of the things I actually just want to call out on this is you see some of these people who are becoming VCs myself included it's awesome to see this trend of people who know this space both at a deep level technical and they are the ones that then know how to invest in the best startups to help solve the right problems alongside of that Siid one of my favorite VCs Sid Treveti partner at foundation capital host the inside the network and then studies how startup scale now if there's one thing I live in the Bay Area along with SiID。

 I run into SiD randomly all of the time he also is an advisor to me many times and if there's one thing about Siid he knows everything that's going on so if you ever want to know anything about a startup or even rumors of a startup go ask Siid he knows what's happening。

And then last but obviously not least Mcalla Vdell。

 is that by the way I believe I'm pronouncing that right， please correct me， okay， we're not。

 head of growth at lineage and an expert on one of the most important aspects of cyber companies today。

 and you know what that is， go to market。You know， it used to be and you know you still have to have a great product。

 you still have to have good technology， but all of you know that especially even today go to market is king or queen of what you need to do in a company today okay so this is our panel of judges already and set to go so what we want to do before we move to our actual companies itself is we want to acknowledge some of the follow follow ups is that the right word。

what it was that？Our honorable mentions， these were the ones that didn't quite get to find list but did have some fantastic companies and technologies。

 so if anyone is in the room that is part of any of these companies please stand we have Air MDR as Company one。

We have Legion Company2， Mind， Mi Tab and SquareX， if any of you guys are in here。

 we want to thank you for also building some fantastic companies and what you've done。

 and we're very looking forward to seeing the kind of success that you're going to have in the future as well。

Okay， so that brings us to our finalists so we have four finalists， Firetail， keep aware。

 prime and twine these are our four finalists now before we get into the finalists coming up and giving their presentations audience what I want you to do is I want you to pay very special attention to their presentations because after they are done it's not just the judges that are going to judge you the audience are also going to judge so we're going to give you time to ask questions from these founders yourselves to get an idea of who do you think the winner should be。

 not just who the judges think the winner should be so pay attention。Okay， so the first company。

 Jeremy Snyder， CEO and founder of Firetale， come on up。Thank you Jeremy okay Jeremy。

 your time starts now。AI is the most disruptive technology that we've seen since the advent of the Internet itself。

It's disrupting industries， the use cases are limitless and it is the number one priority for the entire C suiteite。

 yet we are repeating the mistakes of the past with new technology adoption。

 security teams are falling behind and they're tempted to say no。

 all of this is at a time when the vast majority of AI usage is ungoverned and the risks to organizations while nearly every organization reports a risk as a direct result of their AI adoption and the rate of security incidents around AI adoption is more than doubling year over year。

At Firetale， our end to end AI security and governance software is here to help teams catch up and make it okay for them to say yes to AI adoption inside their organizations。

We provide end to end visibility with continuous AI discovery and observability， L L M testing。

 all of which builds towards a consolidated security posture view and allows organizations to define governance policies around acceptable AI adoption within their organization。

 Let's start the demo and see how it works。😊。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_49.png)

The first step in any security program is establishing visibility。

 Firetale does this by integrating with cloud platforms and code environments。

 No proxy or endpoint software to install on the user side， a managed browser plugin。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_51.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_52.png)

Collect your user interactions with LLM and vibecode environments。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_54.png)

All of this together builds towards a consolidated AI inventory of the models， versions， regions。

 down to the level of system prompts that you have。

 including the variables where your data is going to be used with these LLMs。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_56.png)

But point in time is not enough。 We also have a unique capability to normalize logs coming off of the different AI as a service and L M provider platforms。

 And now you can build single detections that span across those。

 You want to know about your PI leakage anywhere。 You can get that and get it pushed into a tool where your security team already lives and breathe today。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_58.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_59.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_60.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_61.png)

L L Ms also introduce a unique black box content manipulation risk to organizations。

 Firetale automates the testing of the L L Ms that you've adopted to identify these specific risks that are relevant for you。

 Now， you can make risk informed decisions about what's okay。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_63.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_64.png)

Our consolidated security posture view aggregates all of your findings across all of your LLMs in one location。

 We can drill down and prioritize and now pick any one of these to understand the risk that we have by simply clicking。

 we can understand quickly specifically which LLM is in question and get alignment to Oaspin miter models to track our progress。

😊。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_66.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_67.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_68.png)

Last， we can build governance policies around what is acceptable for our organization。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_70.png)

Let's say we want to block deepse。 Well， with just a few clicks。

 we can not only identify all the deepse that we already have in the organization。

 but be notified instantly when new deepse usage is detected。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_72.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_73.png)

Let's take a more complex view where GDPR regulated。

 We can only use L L Ms where we have user consent and in the geographies identified very quickly。

 again， we can identify all of our policy violations and again。

 be notified whenever we step out of bound。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_75.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_76.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_77.png)

There are many challenges in securing AI， everything from model testing and private data。

But one thing that we've learned in adopting new technologies from cloud to Saas to applications to new data stores is that when you get in the way of adoption。

 you create incentives for more shadow I T。 A winning strategy is security。

 posture management and governance。 This is squarely where Firetale sits。

We have experienced decades of technology disruption。Our team has built。

 designed and strategized security posture management strategies at large scale organizations around the world。

We're supported by leading cyber investors and advisors。

 and we take a data driven research oriented approach to what we do that's been recognized by leading analysts。

We also know that all AI adoption happens over APIs， from a simple LLM prompt to aent and MCP。

 It's also the attack surface targeted by attackers。

Firetale has a unique combination of AI and API security capabilities to identify and mitigate these risks。

Last， we also know that AI comes in all shapes and sizes， from workload to workforce。

 from cloud to code， and we're there for all of it。Most importantly， our customers love us。

 We deliver value to them， and unlock innovation。No organization should have to sacrifice security to gain speed or innovation。

 especially when the opportunity present is the potential change of AI。 Thank you very much。😊，Jeremy。

 wow Jeremy， do you mind talking a little bit about what's happening in the competitive landscape。

 particularly what players in the SaS security posture management or the enterprise browser security or very much the AI native security players are doing in this space look there's a ton of stuff going on as I mentioned there's a lot of challenges and I'm not here to say that we address every single one of them and there's a lot of different approaches to them on the quote unquoteAI native security side of things what we're seeing is a lot of efforts to get in between the user and the AI platform。

 whether that's with an endpoint agent or with a proxy。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_79.png)

In our view， that creates incentives for users to go around。 We've seen it time and again。

 rewind 10 years when we had the question of CSPM versus CASby， there's a clear winner in that space。

 you allow innovation， but you monitor it and you control it。 In other spaces。

 I do think the SPM providers are doing interesting things around looking at co-pilots and things like that。

 Our focus is to help you with your AI as a service， your AI powered workloads， and yes。

 what your users are doing in browsers。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_81.png)

Can you speak a little bit to what the role of the person in the organization is you're sitting in front of this because I see things that make me think I'm in the security team and then I see things are very Devsec opsishh and I'm wondering how you sort those out。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_83.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_84.png)

I think we have value for a lot of personas， but I will tell you the number one question that we're getting asked right now is actually that of an infosec leader where the business leader is coming to them and saying。

 hey， what AI are we using today， who's using it， where how， what is it。 And are we okay with it。

 And that's really the first set of questions that we're helping organizations answer。

 that discovery and inventory and then the risk assessment of that inventory is really where all of our customer conversations start to your point。

 Yes， there's a lot of value that we can add and kind of let's say the shift left。

 understand the code that you're building in an agent solution where it's a combination of your code and the As and your code and the thirdparty LLM system。

 Yes， there's a lot of things there。 But most of our conversations really start with that discovery and awareness。

So can you give me a quick idea of how you're charging for you just said who you're charging like you price it Yeah。

 so there was a pricing slide， but we price based on the number of system prompts and the number of AI logs process per month if I remember right。

 I feel a little embarrassed， I think 250 system prompts 250 million logpis per month is 4000 a month。

You quickly mentioned about APIs and MCP， can you talk just a little bit about how you're doing that Yeah。

 it's a great question， look， we started our journey about three years ago as an API security company and we realized over time that like I said。

 all AI adoption happens over APIs and we had a lot of customers asking us we're using APIs more and more to communicate with these thirdparty systems。

The things that we built on the API security side were the ability to shift left and analyze code。

 Look at your APIs。 Are they wellcon。 Are you sanitizing， validating， controlling inputs and outputs。

 to have authentication on all your endpoints。 A lot of kind of basic design flaws with APIs。

 We also looked at the configuration of the cloud environments where you're running your APIs。

 your ws， your API gateways， etc。 And we automated some API security testing as well and put that together to provide kind of a very complete security assessment of an API。

 We now couple that with the AI security capabilities that we've brought out。

CanI ask one question as well。 I just wanted to understand a bit more about how the different elements of the product work together。

 And you have the testing， the governance and policy。

 How does that all kind of fit together for the customer？ Yeah。

 so it all starts with gathering the inventory。 And we gather the inventory with the three methods that I mentioned code scanning。

 cloud scanning and the browser plugin。😊。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_86.png)

We normalize that into one kind of object model inside the inventory。

 Then we analyze that against a set of filters。 Really。

 it's a filter system to identify particular conditions。

 And it's the combination of those filters that helps you identify risk。 So， for instance。

 LLM testing might tell you that a particular inventory item being an LLM has a particular risk score。

 So the way that it all comes together is this kind of discovery pipeline that flows into an object model。

 And on top of that object model， you kind of issue queries， if you will， that tell you good， bad。

 Yes， no， that type of thing。 Does that makes sense。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_88.png)

Yeah， that makes me saying thank you。 And on the pricing side of things then are all of those individual elements all in one model and then there's no kind of premium for different areas of the product No are you saying we should we should upt We're happy to do that I'm just interested to see how it will yeah develop。

 yeah yeah we are too but that's where we are today Okay thank you。😊，Awesome。

 well there's no more questions， judges， audience， thank you very much。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_90.png)

Okay， thank you， Jeremy。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_92.png)

All right， let's go to our next presenter， Ryan， come on up， CEO and founder of Keepware。Okay， Ryan。

 you're ready， how we go。Okay， go for it。Hi everyone， I'm Ryan Bner， founder and CEO of Keepware。

 and I'm going to show you how we secure every browser。Let's start with the corporate security stack。

 We all know this stack because it's what we've used over the last decade to protect employees in the web browser。

 The funny thing is， though， none of these really own the browser。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_94.png)

All of these activities now are taking place in the web browser， whether it be email， file sharing。

 Gen AI tools， Zoom， but there's no clear handoff on which one of these tool owns the browser。

 I know this because I was in those logs firsthand going through Sassy。

 NDR email EDR logs just to figure out what got clicked on。And attackers know this， too。

 They know that the browser stores's critical information。

 They know that personal and work context are hard to manage in the browser。

 They know that an extension with the right permissions can be catastrophic。

 They know that Swwig fails to identify and protect against reasseble malware。 And then lastly。

 they know， like all of us， identity lives in the browser。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_96.png)

So what do we do about it， Well， the enterprise browser， remote browser isolation。

 browser wrappper space has evolved over the last couple of years。

 but it's not a clear fit for most employees。 What is is the lightest weight extension that can run across any browser。

😊，That can provide visibility back to the security team without disrupting users， without tunneling。

 proxying or decrypting information。And Keepware does this。

 Keepware has two sets of use cases around enterprise risk， corporate risk and insider threats。

 as well as browser detection and response to prevent some of the things that I just mentioned。

We call it security at the point of click， because that's technically what it is。

 We embed ourselves into the Dom treee or the document object model。

 And what this does is it's key to the presentation in the interaction layers of the browser。

 We actually use browser encapsulation to wrap every activity that the web app and the user are doing。

 and we run this cross detections that understand tactics。

 techniques and procedures that attackers are using in the browser to， of course， respond。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_98.png)

What makes it unique is that now we have a browser specific data model that we can combine with email network and endpoint that maps to mire attack。

 And what this does is it allows an investigation to go from hours to minutes。

I'll show a quick demo here。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_100.png)

So as you can see， I'm searching for pivot table help in Google。 I go to a legitimate site。

 and it's compromised by clear fake。😊。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_102.png)

Keep where steps in， but I'm going to skip through this so you can see the full attack。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_104.png)

Immediately， you'll see it again。 And I try to download that recomped malware。 It's gonna not work。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_106.png)

Then you see a secondary attack that's actually click fix。

 It's getting me to copy malicious Powershell out of the browser。

 And that safeguard stops that interaction as well。

 It doesn't matter if this is an employee or something else using the browser。

 Here's a second example where an AI agent is actually reading my emails completing tasks。

 and it falls for a document style phishing attempt。😊。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_108.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_109.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_110.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_111.png)

It doubles down and actually continues through to the phish page and puts in my credentials directly into the page。

 But again， that interaction is important because we can stop it there， too。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_113.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_114.png)

Like I said， hours to minutes， so on the other side。

 the security team can see click by click tab by tab what happened in the browser。

 we can see I search for Google， opened a new tab， we can see that injection take place of that fake update your browser。

 and then we can also see that copy of the Powershell was blocked and that DOm model behind it。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_116.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_117.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_118.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_119.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_120.png)

One example really isn't enough。 We have dozens of clients that say two things。

 Keepware gives them unprecedented visibility into the browser。 And then secondly。

 they have flexibility and control over any browser that's already in use in the company。

And we've got the right team to do it。 We have 4 million raised to date。

 and we were born building in the browser。 We're a young team。

 but we also know the pain of working around it。Our go to market simple because we're focused towards security operations。

 we focus on browser based research and key integrations in the security stack。And then lastly。

 we're approaching set ops and architecture teams because those are the ones securing the users。

Lastly， I said， secure any browser， but it doesn't matter who's using it or what's using it。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_122.png)

Thank you for your time。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_124.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_125.png)

Can you quickly go into how your technology differs from some of the other enterprise browsers we've seen recently？



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_127.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_128.png)

So we're fully API based。 What that means is we are purely a middleware or shim in the existing browser through our extension。

 we have no need for pops， no need for any sort of tunneling or proxying behind the scenes。

 and so it's purely a sidecar。A lot more flexible， a lot less complications with applications and trying to unpack different web apps。

 That's really what we're seeing。 The second one is just because we built from the Sock perspective。

 we provide so much visibility into what's happening in the browser。

 And then we put the policy and threat detection response on top。

 So what that means it's less of a black box。 You see exactly what we're thinking when we do something。

😊。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_130.png)

So mobile and desktop browsers， and is the fidelity of your alert feed out of one or the other different。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_132.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_133.png)

No， because we're extension based。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_135.png)

We deploy to Chrome Edge Firefox Safari， any chromroium based browser on top of that。

 as well as Safari for iOS， Android for Firefox， and because the browser technologies ultimately come back to the same thing。

 we have the same detections across all of them。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_137.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_138.png)

What is your POC process？

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_140.png)

So I come from dark Trace where we're shipping an appliance and we just let it sit silent for as long as we can handle。

 So a little of that has trickled into keep aware where we actually like to deploy the extension in a silent mode。

 And let people see it across their employee base because it's in that silent mode。

 we tend to convince folks to push it out to HR， push it out to anyone who's you're worried about using AI tools are being fished in the company。

 And while we don't always find a threat in 30 days， there's always something。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_142.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_143.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_144.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_147.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_148.png)

So when you are deploying this at a company just through what an MDM and it can go to tablets phones is there a limitation to what and then the second thing is how do you charge for this。

 I think I may have missed that Yeah so we're per user per month typically on an annual term and then we do deploy through traditionally through an MDM some folks are still using group policy SSCM usually it boils down to the same things on the device setting registry keys on Windows or Mac it's through their managed profile system。

 but you can also just download the extension from the extension store。

 connect your business email and it just works。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_156.png)

How much of this is asa to the CIO versus the CecL。

 and how do you think about convincing that leader to make a broad push across all employees？



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_158.png)

That's a great question because a lot of times we get。

 how are you different than Island or the enterprise browser space。

 And I think we haven't had a true bake off because typically the CIO is looking at that more policy- drivenven architecture。

 whereas we're purely selling to the security team。

 the SoC and the security engineering under the CO。 And there was a second part to your question。😊。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_160.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_164.png)

How do you ensure that it gets pushed out across the employee base？



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_166.png)

Through the trial or just in general。 So we have an MI installer that can tell what browsers are on the machine and it can report back telemetry to know if something's installed。

 or if someone installs a new browser， auto injects into that， that you know。

 a new brave browser that someone just downloaded。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_168.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_169.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_170.png)

Where are you seeing the most traction as far as company size and vertical？



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_172.png)

So because I'm coming from from dark Trace。 I I replicated their model very early on。

 So a lot of our initial customers were actually mid market。

 But because of the enterprise browser education， we're seeing a lot more enterprise attention and inbound from that。

 So we've gone upmarket in the last year。 What I mean by that is 3000 to 20000 employee。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_174.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_175.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_176.png)

Orgs and then industry， I would say。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_178.png)

Mainly three。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_180.png)

Health services。Financial services and then really broader pro services like accounting legal law firms。

 I like to think we don't sell to the bank or to the hospital directly。

 but everyone who has to work with them and maintain this the same compliance。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_182.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_183.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_184.png)

Awesome， thank you everyone， thank you Ryan。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_186.png)

Okay， thank you， Ryan， next up， Dmitri。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_188.png)

Are you ready？Dmitri Schwartzman from Prime Security。All right， ready， okay， go。

Like many of you here， I love Star Wars and always try to learn from it。 Take the death。

 and Uber fortified planet Diser。 and yet two missiles， tiny exhaust port， poof。

 it goes a classic design fl。 Hi， I'm Dimitri cofounder and chief product officer of Prime security。

 Prime was founded by forefront， who combined bring over 70 years of experience。 across security。

 go to market and R And D。 hence the gray hair。 I'm not adult。

 I've just been doing security for a very long time。😊，Speaking of all。

 security design reviews have always been around on Prem cloud advanced ID pipelines。

 we've always been doing them and predominantly manually。

 but today as skull becomes commodity and anyone can share products be it HR or marketing。

 that gap is widening and design becomes the main frontier for risk。So obviously。

 the current processes are unsustainable。 Teams are reactive， understaffed。

 and the output is very inconsistent。 Let's talk about cost for a second。 cryrypto dot Com hack。

 Another very typical classical design flaw resulted in a $34 million loss。 and on a personal note。

 six years of Paypal， where my 8 security architects were trying to support 10000 developers taught me just how expensive security rework really is。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_190.png)

This is where prime security comes in， your agent security architect。

Prime identifies and mitigates risk at the design stage by analyzing the previously locked business context。

 Let's see prime in action。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_192.png)

Post a simple integration with any task management system and cloud storage for context and calibration。

 Prime is off to do its thing。 First up blueprints。

 high level overview of key components in the environment。

 Our operator wants to leverage the visibility prime provides。 So in scopes。

 he filters for the current sprint and the cloud infrar team， which is a known blind spot。

 Once he does a particular line stands out a project that is ongoing that he's never seen before。

 Simple click and he gets all the context about it that he needs as well as a detailed breakdown of risk。

 Why prime flagged it。 But let's be honest， this is security。

 We've never worked a single item without context switching。 So， of course。

 he gets paying by a dev manager that needs a review right away and theres a big meeting in a couple of hours。

 So in security reviews， our operator paste the link and runs a review。 within minutes。

 he gets a very detailed outcome with the expected outcome。

 detailed data flow main components in the relationship between them。 a attack。😊，And， of course。

 recommendations。Prime also spots that actually， this BD is related to the infoar work that our operator spotted with a simple click。

 He adds it， reprosses and now can hand over a comprehensive review back to the dev manager。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_194.png)

But we've already seen that that work is already ongoing and so the developers who are working at a company leverage cursor。

 thanks to Prime， all of the risks already integrated with the recommendations across the agent pipeline。

 no extra steps needed secure by design。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_196.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_197.png)

This is oh。Can we skip back one， sorry。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_199.png)

Alright， this is a $9 billion market that keeps on growing。

 There are over 10000 companies where Cils project experts and security engineers feel the pain daily。

 Our motto is very simple， as easy as our integration。 We offer per developer pricing。

Prims already helping companies such as Qualtrics， Thoughpot and Oscar Health to gain near 100% of visibility into their design stage。

 10 times faster security reviews and 40% reduction of risk。Redox， a leading health tech provider。

 implemented automated security reviews， which are mandated by high trust without slowing down development。

Prime is very well positioned to own the design space。

 thanks to our unique context of our risk engine and the fact that we integrate and meet developers where they at without the need to change anything substantially。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_201.png)

And， of course， security reviews are just the beginning。

 We're aiming to expand our urgent platform into automatic remediation fixes。

 as well as enrichment in context and， of course， unman security knowledge base for everyday use。

Thank you。 And made the force be with you。Do you have any existing integrations with enterprise architecture platforms like SAP Le IX。

 So we're expanding our integrations all the time。 It really depends on where the context exists based on our customers。

 So the main purpose is how can we enrich the information as we go further。

 So we're actually constantly expanding today， we have multiple connectors。

 whether it's the task measuring systems or whether if it's either integrations but the intent is really to make sure that we understand the business as best as possible。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_203.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_204.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_205.png)

So the security engineerlash architect Appec person does that really quick review gets it ready to go。

 You mentioned that the information needss the target engineer where they're at can you give me a little more information like how does it go from the console that the App person is using to the developer who needs to fix the thing So there's a couple of ways So the first thing because we want to be very preemptive I'm not saying proactive I'm very careful of that about our security。

 the whole intent is to identify the risks and the mitigation steps and for them to be specific。

 we've gone through a lot of conversations and tuning to make sure that our recommendation are not too generic we take those and we complete the entire cycle by writing them back into the task management So this way before we really want to be at that intersection before it moves into and code is created So the intent is to create whether if it's tasks or write this as comments into where the developer。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_207.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_208.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_209.png)

A at So now as they start shifting into what's happening in their next sprint and that task is picked up。

 they really see all of the security requirements baked in。

So quick question on sort of behind the scenes how it works right so you're feeding a lot of information in you're having an LLM spit out the written stuff and putting all this together so can you talk a little bit about the governance behind the scenes of making sure that that is one the summary is accurate and it's not making something up along the way and that whoever is asking it to do it is only seeing the parts that they need to see and that you're complying with various regulations around what's being able to be shown in different places so just talk a little bit about the governance course of that Yeah so I'll start with the first part of the question which is awesome we spend a lot of time and that's why it's the context that were piece to extract information and correlate it from multiple pieces and then expose all of that chain back to back to the operator to make sure that they see one how we've done this because we've constructed and built and ontology。

 by the way， the ontology they didn't come just from。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_211.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_212.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_213.png)

I've been doing this manually for so long that me and my head of product we just sat down and translated that so that now we can do it widely fill those fill that information and where we don't have。

 we actually flag and say to the owner to the operator， hey。

 insufficient information which serves by the way， two purposes one。

 we're building that trust that if it doesn't exist we're not gonna make it up just we don't have where to bring that information into that ontology so either go and figured that out with the person or maybe make a decision without it if it's not that critical and so because we're very transparent in how we do risk and how we build our ontology and how we do our analysis that trust is build more and more and so more customers more and more one to see full on automation to the other piece we don't train any models we don't take any information from the customers we've actually I'd love to say this that we use all of them as a tool not as a solution we applied。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_215.png)

toolol were needed and we're not it's just good old fashioned security that we've translated from manual to machine right we leverage we as based solution AWS。

 we leverage bedrock and so we already the all existing baked in privacy security we just leverage it and expose that to the customer So it's not on our end it's just we leverage existing infrastructure So real quick a follow up one of course do you do anything to monitor the way it talks right so if it starts to speak in a sort of off brand when it's giving you the answers back in a summary are you doing anything to make sure that it's kind of consistent language across the board and it doesn't kind of drift and like documents today look a little different than they do six months from now So we've spent again very good question we spent a lot of time in validating that consistency the way that I present to potential customer saying treat Prime as a junior security architect it's very well it knows。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_217.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_218.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_219.png)

Amazing security， it has basic understanding of the company。

But it's junior because it doesn't exactly know how it is。 The more you operate。

 the smarter it becomes。Thanks very much。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_221.png)

Thank you Mi。 Thank you。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_223.png)

Okay。Last but not least。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_225.png)

Benny。Come on up from Te security。Yeah。Welcome， thank you very， good luck。Thank you， being last。

Imagine the power with multiple AI digital employees。Sharing knowledge， instantly。Each breakthrough。

 elevating the entire team。Having multi discipline AI employees working together is the transformative future of cyberseity。

😊，This is our vision。In a recent interview， Jamie Damon said。

Hisory is the greatest teacher of all time。😊，That liner stays with me。

Today's cyber teams look a lot like the rigid French defensive line from World War I。😊，Static tools。

 silo specialist， and AI merely used to reinforce yesterday' defenses。Likewise。

 our common cybersecurity programs are built for the past。😊。

They will not handle the increased complexity of the coming threats。Tools have to be more dynamic。

Processes need to move from PDFfs to live in workflows。

Cyber staff need to move from the frontline to the command center， directing， not doing。

We are reaching a tipping point where complexity is outpacing human cognition。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_227.png)

At W， we believe the future of cyber defense lies in the rise of AI workforces。

 intelligent systems that collaborate with human， not just automating task。😊。

Our team has worked together for many years， building clarity into a billion dollar company。😊。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_229.png)

And is back by top VCs and Ns。We've built a solution inside the most complex Fortune 500 companies delivering value at speed and scale。

😊，We are bringing our deep operation experience to Te。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_231.png)

After having validation calls， with over 200 seesaws。One thing was clear。

Identity is a silent driver of risk。Not from lack of visibility， tools or people。😊。

But from the cognitive overload and complexity。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_233.png)

This is why we build Alex。Our first AI digital employee is an identity expert who joins your team to investigate。

 explore and solve problems just like a traditional playwood。😊，Once deployed。

 Alex start like Andy K dialer。😊，You autonomously gather context， collaborate with the business unit。

 and take action。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_235.png)

Alex is Sa base， its brain is built as a multi agent system。

 each one dedicated to solving a different piece of the execution challenge。😊。

Starting with agents understand risk and build workflow to our investigator agent that make Alex an expert in your business environment and data。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_237.png)

And many more。So let's see it Xs in action。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_239.png)

Action。So it is Alex right now you are watching Alex investigate an identity incident。

 autonomously gather full context， understand the risk and identify the relevant stakeholder。😊。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_241.png)

It then collaborated with the business unit in order to identify the best practice mitigation plan that fit both the business and the cyberse requirement。

 Lastly， it take the action。😊。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_243.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_244.png)

Alex can solve many different problems。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_246.png)

Come come to our booth and challenge Alex what you' on。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_248.png)

Today， identity is the most fragmented part of cyberseity。

 with over $20 billion spending only last year。😊，It's people who hold it all together。

 bridging dozens of point solution。Solving this is not about hiringing other people。

 to hire more people or buying more tools。It takes connecting all the dots， continuous learning。

And truly understanding of the business。It takes AI， digital employees。At We。

 we're proud to deliver the first AI digital employee train as a Den expert。

 and it's already at work in two of the five largest food and beverage companies， managing over 6。

5 million identities。😊。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_250.png)

But this is more than a product。It's a philosophy。Your best people shouldn't be in the trenches。

 They should be directing intelligent system that do the work。At wine， that future is oral。

 and this is just the beginning。😊。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_252.png)

Thank you。Is your pricing model attached to the identities？



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_254.png)

Could you expand that， Madeline？It was the easy answer。 Yeah， so our pricing model。

 basically we have today， Alex basically is four different models， solving different objectives。

 Basically this is what the customer wants， solving different objectives and each of the model is priced based on the number of human identities that you have in your environment。

😊。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_256.png)

Can you talk a little bit about the governance behind the agents and how you ensure that they're doing what they're supposed to do and not sort of going off the rails on their own。

 Amaz question。 So basically， because the current set of the market， basically。

 this is the number one thing that we need to do。50% of our developing time is about how we control Alex。

And we make sure to deliver the trust。 We make sure that there is no way Alex will do something you're not supposed to do。

 Basically， we develop something we call the control membrane。

 This is justy name that basically make sure that you act like a firewall between Alex and the actual execution all right action in your environment。

 And you can basically define and configure exactly what you allowed to do and what not in which cases。

 So basically full control at all time about what you actually do and， of course。

 you can monitor everything。😊，Do you provide sort of in the system or reporting howvey do it but a way to get like an audit or explainability information to be able So if you do get audit like why did this happen。

 are you able to explain this is why we did what we did that for sure so basically everything else is doing is under activity logs that basically show every different step we took in any different objective they're trying to solve and for each one of them we are keep the reasoning about why you decide to do that。

 of course what I think the beauty of it that you can teach Alex。

It's not like we have so many tools that generate for us generic。Finding and doing genetic stuff。

 we want tools that do for us for our business。 customized to our own。 And basically。

 when you look into the reason， you can tell like， no， actually， in our environments。

 we want to be different and immediately get it。 And the next time all the time。

 we' will do it by your business。 Okay， so I'm going to follow up on that。

 What if you have a really bad security analyst who's training it to do things wrong。😊。

So I didn't understand that question。 What if you have a bad security analystmoos who's telling you to do the wrong thing。

 How do you So keep it from doing that。 So， of course， Alex can with an albumba on top of it。

 And only specific today， only like I proven a user allowed to give Alex guidelines about how to do stuff exactly because of that problem。

😊，Benny， how much of the ultimate goal is to replace an IAM solution versus sit on top of it？

Other person on top of it。We have so many tools in our ecosystem。 we need。

Digital employee to use object the our tools to achieve our objectives。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_258.png)

We are not here to replace any of the IM tools。 We are able to make the IM tools that we already purchased。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_260.png)

And make them deliver your objective。 Basically， you help your people， make them superhuman。

 You make your human super humans in achieving their objective with existing tools。😊。

Where do your customers find funding for this investment， So is it coming from displaced people。

 Is it additional realized value from existing investments， So actually， it's pretty simple。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_262.png)

Because。Of course Alice generate a lot of value from implicit satisfaction because of mass better SLA and all the different posts in IM that are very problematic。

 it generate a lot of security value， of course， to reduce actually the risk of your environment。

 but it also save you tons of time。😊。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_264.png)

Tons of time。 So basically， the ROI is so clear。 So basically we usually get it just from the eight counts budget。

Followingollow question， is there a scenario where employees accessing production or get just in time access privileges。

 is that something that you may be able to service？Like doing from Alex just in time。 Yeah。

 so I don't want my employees to have full time access and fraud。

 I'm working this ticket peer justification。 Can I do this Yeah so at the end。

 Alex is accessible based on， of course， what the customer decide to every employee to teams or slack and you can define different process。

 you can tell Alex， look， you're allowed to get this kind of question and to do this type of task with this type of policy。

And you can basically define doing what to do。 Like it's it's mimicking the human。

 like what the human will do。 So if you think about。

 if you want to implement implement just in time provisioning with humans， it's the same。O。Thank you。

 Benny， thank you。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_266.png)

Oh's not。 I sorry， but you can do it。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_268.png)

All right excellent okay so the judges have a lot to think about those were some pretty interesting presentations so now judges I believe it's time for you guys to go off in a dark room somewhere and fight it out is that what happens back there what do you guys do is there like fist fights is that yelling screaming？



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_270.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_271.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_273.png)

I hope so like we should record these things because it would be fun to watch okay so as the judges get up and go deliberate and figure out who the winner is。

 we're going to take last year's winner who is both a good friend of mine Sunil and Ggnostic who I am also an investor in and he's going to come up and talk a little bit about what has happened in the year of what he's done since his last winning so Sunil you want to come on？

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_280.png)

It's a nice。You know what I should have actually recreated the scenario from last year。

 which is after we heard that we won。 I ran and did this leaping jump onto the stage。 So well。

 maybe I'll do that a little later， but I expect whoever the winner is to do the same。

 So I had this it was a wonderful experience last year to win I got into the mode where I thought I lost。

 And so when we actually won， I was genuinely excited。

 and it's been a great year where we've had a chance to just celebrate the win but also take it further and see what else could happen。

 that's not just from the publicity that we got but also to be able to say okay we really validated the capability that we were building。

 So anyway so last year we did this this year， we also competed in a much smaller competition with less beautiful judges or the judges to here。

 but anyway， we were able to secure some additional funding through the competition。 and it was nice。

😊，ToTo have additional validation there， again， a much smaller conference。

 much smaller competition than what we have here。 But here's the question， really。

Just because we want a competition， does that really translate into market success？

And the reality is， no， it doesn't。 There's a lot more than just winning a competition。

 And if you even look at the winners of the competition here or this other competition that we've heard about。

 the winners don't always， there aren't always successful。 And if you think about it。

 it's because there's a lot more than just winning a competition。

 And if we think about whether competition really focuses on。

 its's this notion that we have this innovative capability and it's born upon this this idea that we have。

 But it's not just about ideas。 If we think about it， there's there's this great quote from Edison。

 that genius is1% inspiration and 99% perspiration。 So in other words， idea is just one part of it。

1% of it。 And the rest is this execution。😊，So the question is。

 what what exactly does execution mean what constitutes execution here And is execution winning a competition？

 No， let me assure you， if that was it， wed be we be in the money。 so to speak。

 I it also getting funding。 Look， we got funding too on top of that。 is it just that。 No。

 is it getting great founders。 Well， I mean， you know， I hope I'm a great founder。

 But I don't think it's just that either。 but it's really a combination of all those。

's having a great idea， having leaders that can execute having a team that you build upon and having a plan for that execution。

 So those founders here， you know， again， just winning a competition isn't all there is。

 you have to do a lot more。 And I think the folks here understand that。

 So just to give you a perspective of our journey。 I'll start with our idea。

 The idea that we had was we think that AI introduces a new layer to the AI to our data stack。

 very much like how we think about the Oi model， we had controls for layer 3 and 4 and。😊。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_282.png)

to comes around and offers a next generation firewall， a layer 7 firewall。

 We think that when it comes to AI， we have a new knowledge layer。

 and we want to be able to control or we need to be able to access that knowledge layer。

 But when we first roll out knowledge tools like Copit or green or Gemini for workspace。

 we start seeing oversharing。😊，And our natural reaction when we see oversharing is we have a data problem。

 or we have to classify our data。 In other words， we're trying to apply an older set of controls against a newer layer problem。

 It's like trying to block a layer 7 protocol with layer 3 and 4 controls。 just doesn't work。

 Furthermoremore， not only does it not work。 We end up squeezing this bottom part of this pyramid。

 which makes the large language model dumber。 And who wants a dumb LLM。 Okay， nobody。

 So our basic idea was we have a new layer。 We have a new way of we need to think differently about the AI and this knowledge layer requires persona based need to know。

 And so we built out a capability to systematically capture need to know and apply that towards many different use cases like。

 for example， quickly finding oversharing， being able to provide topical or semantic labeling and being able to provide controls for persona based access to content。

 So that was our idea。 but it's not just。😊，I， again， that's just 1% of the challenge。

 Then we also need to have a team。 And so my cofounder and I gotti everyone， we we said， okay。

 we think that we need to build this capability。 Nobody else is doing it。 And together。

 we we then built our own team。 We built a team that of top notch folks to deliver against this overall capability。

But then lastly， again， it's not just the leader。 It's not just an idea。 It's not just the leaders。

 It's not just a team， but also plan of execution。 And for us， we of course， have to build a product。

 You have to build build a team to build deliver against a real it can't just be vaporware。

 I think I was looking at one of the ads for I won't make fun of them。

 But they called the product airs。 Okay， I'm thinking an industry that is full of vaporware calling your product air is probably not good marketing。

 so you have to， you have to build real product。 And it can't just be a layer on top of an LLM。

 It has to be something that substantially works。 And so that's what we we spent the last year and a half basically building out real capability。

 We of course， need funding。 We We were able to raise additional funding because of the wins that we've had。

 Or at you know， there's a lot of publicity that we get。

 And so we see a lot of folks interested in in us。 and of course， great marketing from the。😊。

That we've had definitely milk it for even if you don't win， even if you don't win。

 milk it for all you can get okay because being I think there were a couple folks who are even like honorable mentions。

 and I tell them go milk it because just the fact that you got into the list the short list is an accomplishment of itself use it to the best effect。

And so that's， that's what we've done。 Is success guaranteed by no means。 But hopefully from there。

 you get a perspective of where we are and how we're trying to strive for success。 And so with that。

 if you know， you know。😊，And we think that we have our LLMs， our loose lip machines。

 and we think that we need to be able to protect need to know if you're interested in what we're doing。

 definitely reach out， happy to talk to you。Thank you， Samo。

So that what does this mean again the shirts I was I mean I don't if you know what it means you will know what it means if you know you know okay got it got it okay I was wondering about that thank youil all right so now we'd like to get I think the finalists the founders back up on stage and we'll set up some chairs okay so this next session audience we need you you are going to be the judges want I want we are going to do an audience vote of who is the winner who do you think is the winner out of the presentations so what we'll do in the first part is we want to allow you guys to ask them questions so you've seen their presentations you've heard what the judges asked what kinds of questions do you have for them。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_284.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_287.png)

And I know you've got them， so we've got these microphones。

 I believe I can't see very well but where they're located somewhere in these areas， one over there。

 I think， and then one over there， please come up， I'd love for you guys to start asking some questions。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_289.png)

We've got four fantastic founders， four fantastic products， and even if you don't even have a。

 hey I want to judge you on your company product， you could even just ask。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_291.png)

Great questions about being a founder or their journey so anything that you've got let's get the okay great we've got that up there so go ahead and scan that QR code and then what that's going to do is hopefully we show up a grid here now we'll show live votes for each of those companies so you will vote for that company and what I hope happens here is this is what we're going for is as each one of these founders answer some questions they may lose a vote or maybe gain a vote from you guys from the audience right like you got to love this okay so scan register get everything up and let's start asking some questions who would like to go first。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_293.png)

Come on guys， I know you want one question。All right， we've got one over here， awesome。Thank you。

It's just a general question， you know what's the hardest part with a startup and especially in the AI space where it seems like everybody is some sort of a ra or how do you distinguish yourselves when trying to use these AILM models？

Yeah， I'm happy to kind of start the conversation there because I there's a couple aspects to what you asked that I would I have some thoughts on。

 Number one， the hardest part of just being in a startup or running a startup is。

Not letting the highs get you too high， the lows get you too low。

 I saw a post from somebody the other day that a startup is really just like showing up day after day after day and having the grit and the perseverance to fight through because。

Yeah， things will go great at times， but things will also go not so great at other times。

 And if you let that get you down， it's really easy to get discouraged very， very quickly。

 every startup makes mistakes along the ways were no exception to that rule。 And like I said。

 if you let that kind of deter you， it's going to be a long ride that you're not going to enjoy。

 and most importantly， if you just think about the fact that the most limited resource you have in life is time。

You want to maximize that。 you should be enjoying what you do。

 it shouldn't be a painful experience to go along the way because if it's a painful experience。

 you probably also don't deliver the best experience to your customers。On the AI side。

 I will say we had a great conversation on Tuesday。

 and Caleb brought up something that I think is really interesting to think about。

 There's a ton of buzzword bingo， and there's a ton of kind of aIwa of things happening in this space and。

😊，He mentioned that， if you can't explain what you're doing with AI or why you're using it where for a specific use case and why AI is actually the required solution for that use case。

That's probably not a good place to use it。 And I think from us。

 we actually thought about not how we can apply AI。

 but actually how we can apply tried to and true techniques to an AI problem。

 and it's a little bit of a different approach I'm sure some of the other founders will have different thoughts because they may be doing different stuff well they are doing different stuff obviously。

 but yeah， that's just my two cents。 and a quick follow up。

 I know you said you started first an API security。

 Yeah when you knew it was a right moment to pivot into what you're doing now。 Yeah。

 I mean look at some point we kind of looked at where we were。

 and we kind of looked at what our growth rate was like。

 that was actually the thing that we focused the most on we saw there was growth。 yes。

 there was positive momentum in certain areas， but it wasn't the rate of growth that we were looking for。

And we actually had the hard conversation like， are we satisfied with this or do we think that we can do more。

 That was really the moment where we started to ask ourselves that question and kind of make that decision。

It's interesting because I always just thought well。

 the entire world is going on fire over MCP when in reality MCP is a thin veneer that is an API and then you just like well clearly clearly clearly everyone's calling MCP the world the language and communication of AI but it's just APIs so like you're just there it's a little bit like a few years ago when there was kind of the first wave of hype around AI which was really around ML and there was this cartoon that I saw that I thought was really great if those of you are familiar with scooby do you remember at the end of the episode there's always the kind of the unmasking of the bandit and there's this like AI care old band Higgins yeah exactly and they unms the bandit and it's basically like if this then that statement and yeah I just think。

There's so much going on， but it is all AI， API is under the covers。Ill just add one thing。

I think there's a bit of illusion that it's a magical solution that can solve a variety of problems and I think one of the biggest realizations that any founder who's working with AI should have is that actually we just got an extra we talk about this all the time an extra tool in our toolbox that can do a variety of things just like every other thing that we have as we build products and as long as you remember that that's a tool that it's not like you're going use a hammer for everything right sometimes you need a screwdrivers same thing with the overall we' kind of generalize AI but the leverage of this new technology needs to be where you actually need it to be because it also helps to explain to your customers how you do what you do and it's not a conversation where you say。

 well I'm using AI I trust me it's magical So just to avoid that I think the more you can explain how you leverage why your leverage then the more trust you build with your customers that。

ates with me because we of course， focus on the browser and specifically the browser signal and I think of Te sitting on top of all of that IAM data and if you have an analyst sitting on all of these logs between NDR。

 EDR and email and they still don't know I go back to what got clicked on or what file Dr and droprop got uploaded well the AI tool is not going to be any better than the human。

 so we focus on the signals and maybe not as much intentionally avoiding AI。

 but it's helped us not have to to answer that question too much which we're focused on the browser。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_295.png)

I will just add that you know For was the number one challenge to build the startup was to generate focus you need to keep your focus and make sure that you are doing the right thing and of course with AI today it's like the noise is like unbelievable it's like from both this customer and everything and especially from like expectation setting like what he can and what he cannot do and we all know that with AI like this first 60% it's pretty easy。

But actually， back to adult%， it's very， very， very difficult。

 So I think this is always was and always will be like generate the focus inside the problems that you really want to solve and make sure that you sort be right。

😊，Okay， great， thank you， that was a great question， thank you so much Ed do we have any others？

Yeah I got a question quickly。 Thank you all for your presentations。 I really enjoyed it。

 But the gentleman from Keep aware。 do you collect any telemetry inside the browser and how do you。

 how are you protecting that from some potential abuse Yeah that's a great question。

 So we're embedding ourselves within the browser， there is a lot of telemetry that we collect and use but because we're not proxing and tunneling that data。

 we're not decrypting it。 our data model that we've created。

 know just think of these JSson representations of events happening in the browser。

 there's no sensitive data that actually leaves the browser to go to our Saas platform。

 So while we might have 350 fields of metadata associated with and upload。

 You're not going see that raw content in upload itself and we don't necessarily need to touch it to know that it has certain data inside of that upload or someone did enter a password on this page we don't necessarily need to tell you the password to solve that。

 Do you see the。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_297.png)

User education user awareness space has a potential market for you and do you have any like independent data on how you're changing click patterns or any of that stuff for some of your customers absolutelyutely so the name of course keep aware it's the first name we came up with even though we wanted to focus on the browser just because of how important that education aspect is within it all and this was before security awareness has sort of gained the name human risk management and I think that these tools are really great at aggregating a bunch of data from all of your different systems and then trying to infer the risk of an individual but with the browser there's a full range of clicks。

 uploads， downloads and you can glean a good amount of that behavior from that single data source。

 So I absolutely think as that space evolves there's going to be a need to have some sort of browser telemetry there as well and then there was a second part of your question around effort。

Absolutely， absolutely， and we have this concept of actions in the browser that range from anything from a simple notice or a nudge or a pause all the way to a full on restriction。

 and our recommendation most of the time is a pause because what we see is over 90% of the time if you pause someone from doing something they stop and they request access or they start to question。

 oh maybe this isn't the right site that I'm on。Okay， great， excellent， any other questions？

Remember guys there's no such thing as a dumb question actually the way I like to think about it is the dumber the question is it's actually the smartest question I gave a presentation these guys referenced it before it's amazing how much when you just keep asking the simple question how hard those things are usually to answer okay we've got somewhere over here thank you。

Thank you。This is a general question for everybody。 But when you think about your brand。

What are the things that you want your customers to associate with you。

And how did you decide how to make sure that those things stood out from what everyone else is doing。

It was a tough one。That's a great question Yeah that gets to your answers are we don't know yet。

 we're still trying to figure it out。Look， there' are some things that are kind of obvious answers to that。

 which is， you know you want your brand also to stand for yes。

 security and kind of solving the problem that the customer comes to you for。

 But you really also wanted to stand for a positive customer experience right So whenever the customer thinks of you Firetale twine people wear prime security。

 whatever it is right they should think， oh yeah， are this is a great team to work with。

 I have always have a positive experience。 I go to them with a question， they have a great answer。

 if they don't have a great answer， they try to help me or they go away and do some research and come back to me with something that is useful and constructive。

 I think if you think about kind of the broader internet that we live in today probably the answer to every question ever imagined is out there one of the biggest pieces of value that you can provide to your customer It' actually saving them time and effort to go out there and find it and do it themselves everything that we've built as founders。

😊，Any company could choose to replicate on their own if they wanted to。

 but there's a reason that they don't。 They can get it faster。 They can get it better。

 They can get it delivered in a kind of a better packaging or a better customer experience than they could do on their own。

 And I want our customers to really feel like that is a value that we delivered to them in addition to solving that problem。

For us， I almost feel like it's a two pronged problem because we have two customers。

 We have who we're actually selling to insecurity， and then we have the employee who's using the browser behind the scenes and so for security。

 we want to be consultative there's so many different use cases we found it's actually kind of a challenge to pick why are people coming to address the browser in their company。

 So we try to take a consultative type of approach and want that to be part of part of the brand。

 but on the employee side， I would just use the word human。

 like we don't necessarily need to appear like the super high tech neon bright colors because that's not what they care about want to do their work and if they get stopped you know we want to make sure that it feels like a natural experience。

I would say that execution。And。Transparency because we know there's so much noise to try to cut through and what I want is to make sure that when people talk about prime security。

 they know that what we promised we deliver and the way we deliver we can explain how we delivered it。

And creating that trust and that consistency is what I think we as Prime put on as one of the most important things for us。

 I don't want to be at a place， none of us want to be at a place where somebody says。

They promised x some other of things just to get their foot in the door and they only delivered on 20% that is a brand killer in my perspective and it's I've been on the other side and I've had these conversations with vendors that I felt like。

At first， that was top priority as soon as the contract was signed like let's stock next quarter in three years。

 maybe something， and it's just not how we build our company。For me， it's the human touch。At the end。

 we have so many tools out there that are generic and basically the vendors themselves building the generic solution for all the different companies。

😊，And what we are coming to bring is that that the human target make all of these generics specific for the specific organization。

So we want to make sure that our customer know that we are ready for them。

 and we are basically specific for them。Okay， so the judges have returned I just want to make sure something do we have an actual vote the winners decided right has that been handed to Sil we just want to make sure that you don't get influenced by anything that's on up here okay great I think we'll do one more question because I know I think we have one guy who has one question we'll do that and then we'll cut to the judge's decision that they came back early so it must been quick it must have been a very quick assistance will be fun okay last question great stuff guys Taylor here from political why are you going to win right now。

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_303.png)

I won't go first this time。😀Yeah。It's because the future is going to change。

 Cybersecurity not going to look the same in the next few years。

 And it's clear that a Gen AI and digital employer are going to dramatically change the way we are using and consuming and actually doing cybersecurity。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_305.png)

![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_306.png)

And it is like， it's literally a transformative moment in cybersecurity。 So it's a clear win。

 You just gained four votes off of that。Off of that answer。

I think for us it's just a relentless focus on what we do well。

 we see with security companies a lot of times the path is to just add more bells and whistles and what we're hearing is that the pieces that we do very。

 very well and the pieces people bias for is because we 10x that particular use case or feature。

 whereas we might not have a billion ways to deploy our browser extension。

 we keep it simple and we focus on those use cases。Yeah， okay， I I saw that Okay， no worries。

 because I I am a very， very true believer in the problem that we're trying to solve。

 And even more I'm a believer in the team that is building the solution。

Because I think we're solving the number one pain point for almost every organization today。

 Everybody's facing this AI decision。 Everybody's facing this whole question of can we do it。

 should we do it， How can we do it， I there risk， There's just a lot of uncertainty coupled with the opportunity and the FOMO and the fear of falling behind your competitors who are willing to go faster than you。

That is a real challenge。 That is a real problem for so many organizations right now。Okay excellent。

 thank you very much all right so Sanil he's got the winner so what's going to be really interesting here is right now we have audience vote of prime security as number one with as the winner with a follow up by twine so now it will be really interesting guys is if what if we have a conflict we have two winners。

Then do they fight？Should we do that， should then we like like clear the stage。

 then then have to wrestle and then whoever wins acting there's a cage that's about to go that。Okay。

 all right， Soil come on up， let's see who the judges， oh there you go。



![](img/51011ca9a37b5e258ec323debf0307c3_308.png)

Well， hold on， wait， That means that the winner can't do what I just did。 to That's too。 Oh。

 you got to give it， you have to come over here。 I think I know you give it to me。 you read it。

 you I be reading Okay， All right， drumrum roll， the winner is。
