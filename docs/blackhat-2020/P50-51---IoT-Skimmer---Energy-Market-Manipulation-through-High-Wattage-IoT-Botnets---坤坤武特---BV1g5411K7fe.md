 Good afternoon， everyone。 Welcome to our talk。 Today， I'm going to present you IoT Skimmer。

 the Energy Market Manipulation through high wattage IoT botnets。

 Let me start with the IoT Skimmer team。 We're a group of researchers in the communication assurance。

 and performance group at Georgia Tech。 I am Tui Chikari， PhD candidate， and my lab mates， Leina Rin。

 who helped me in data analysis and collection。 And we're both advised by the director of the lab。

 and also our PhD advisor， Dr。 Bea。 Let's start with the brief background on the power grid。

 structure。 Generally， every power grid has three main sectors， generation， transmission。

 and distribution。 In the generation section， the major portion。

 of the required energy by the customers， is generated by big producers。

 such as nuclear power plants， or wind farms， solar farms， hydraulic power。

 Then the generated power is transmitted over long distances。

 using transmission lines or the transmission sector。 And then when it nears the customers。

 the voltage is stepped down。 And the energy is distributed among the end users。

 with distribution lines or in the distribution sector。 At the end of this chain。

 we have the commercial， or industrial users， and also we have the residential customers。

 Like any other industrial control system， power grid has its own specific and proprietary communication。

 network and also the control algorithms。 For the communication network that。

 is responsible for collecting the measurements， throughout the power grid to make them available for the monitoring。

 and decision-making purposes in the control center。

 we have a system called Supervisory Control and Data， Acquisition System or SCADA System。

 And this system is responsible to collect different measurements。

 throughout the power grid from different substations， and power plants。 The raw data， then。

 they are communicating。 They are sent back to the control center。

 They are being monitored by the human operators， and they have automated manual tools。

 to process the raw data and make control decisions， on the process data。

 Then they send back the decisions to the substations， and also the power plants。

 And the decisions could be switching specific power。

 line or even changing the output power generation。

 of a specific generation or a specific power plant。

 With the explosion of the high performance computing devices。

 and also with the emergence and explosion of measurement， devices in the power grid。

 the concept of the power grid， has changed a lot。 For example， the term of a smart grid。

 has been introduced in recent years， which includes the high penetration。

 of the computing devices and also the measurement devices。

 And we don't have this vertical structure， that I mentioned in the previous slide anymore。

 in this new environment。 The power generation can be partly。

 done in the customer side and also in the generation side。 And also。

 we have a much more efficient system， in terms of energy consumption。

 And this new smart grid concept provided us， with cheaper energy。

 Now let's talk about the electricity market。 Traditionally。

 everything from the generation transmission， to the end users and the distribution systems。

 were owned by the government owned parties。 But in the late 1990s。

 the concept of restructured power， system was introduced。

 The basic concept was to moving from the government owned。

 entities to private owned and competitive environment。 In this new environment。

 the generation companies， and the retailers can participate in the market， and offer their prices。

 And this is a competitive environment， which provides us with better prices and also the energy。

 efficiency。 And according to the United States statistics in year 2018。

 the total transactions on the electricity markets in the US， were more than $168 billion。

 So we have a structure similar to this in the electricity market。 We have some generators。

 We have big retailers or resellers。 And these two group of players， they submit their bids。

 to the market saying that I'm going， to buy this much of energy for this price。

 And the other player is going to say， I'm going to sell this much of energy for this price。

 The market operator clears the market， and the price is determined。 So it's a totally free market。

 And the retailers are responsible for participating， in the volatile daily market。

 But they're offering usually the fixed rate to the end users。

 And this makes their work very challenging indeed。 They can't offer very low prices because they。

 may lose in the market and they can't offer very high prices， because they will lose customers。

 This system has been implemented in a lot of regions， around the world。

 The entire system hasn't been transformed， into the restructured system。

 We still have the traditional structure， in some parts of the board。

 But the most of the power grid in most of the countries。

 have been transformed into the new structure。 For example， in the US。

 we have nine different regions， that the restructure power grid or the electricity markets。

 have been developed。 Two of the biggest ones， of course。

 are California market and the New York market。 And each of these markets has two sub-markets。

 the day ahead and real time。 In the day ahead market--。

 so the players participate in this market one day， before the actual operation。

 And they're making bids offers for the next day。 So they're doing this based on the load forecasting。

 The thing is that based on the historical data， the market players can make predictions。

 on the loads for the next day to some extent， with a certain amount of error， for example。

 5% to 10%。 But there is usually a load forecasting errors。

 And also there are also unpredictable events， such as the outage of the generators。

 or even outage of a specific transmission line， which， might affect the prices。

 So in real time market， to compensate， this mismatch between the generation and consumption。

 which happened in real time， because we can't entirely， control the load in real time。

 There is a real time market。 Again， the players submit their bids。

 The prices might be higher or lower。 It's more volatile than the day ahead market。

 But the existence is necessary to make the real time， load balance generation。

 Now let's move to the IoT botnets。 IoT botnets have been recently introduced。

 into the cybersecurity domain。 Most famous one was Mariah botnet。

 which was discovered in August 2016。 It included over 600，000 compromised devices。

 And it was used indirectly to attack other domains， which， even properly secured。

 such as the Brian Krebs website， who's a cybersecurity journalist。 Also。

 it was used in another set of distributed denial， of service attacks。

 But after the release of the source code of this botnet， similar botnets have emerged。

 such as law bot， a GMAP， a record bot。 And they're distributed all over the world。

 So we're going to even hear more about IoT botnets， in the future。

 And this figure shows the geographical distribution， of this market of this botnet。

 But as far as for the attacks on the financial markets。

 there has been a lot of market manipulation cases， which。

 can be defined as a deliberate and malicious， interference with the market values。

 to create an artificial price for a tradable entity。 Usually distributed denial of service attacks。

 were launched to interrupt these markets， and target their availability。

 Two of the most famous ones I've mentioned in this slide。 Attacks on the electricity markets。

 There has been always market manipulation cases， in electricity markets。

 But we have no proof or evidence on the existence。

 of any significant cyber attack on the electricity market。 For example。

 in the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission， reported 16 potential market manipulation cases to in 2018。

 and 14 of which were closed with no action。 But most recently， in the past couple of months。

 the UK electricity market experienced the major cyber， attack。

 And you can read the detailed article here。 So it started to heat up this specified field。

 IoT botnet attacks on the power grid， have been emerging in his study recently。

 It was introduced by Solton and his colleagues， in Princeton University。

 And the title of the paper was Black IoT。 It was presented in USNIC Security 2018。

 The basic idea was that as an attacker， you have access to a high wattage IoT botnet。

 whose bots are consuming high watts。 And they can consume high energy， such as H-WACK systems。

 water heater， air conditioner。 It was mentioned in the paper that if the attacker can。

 simultaneously turn on or off these devices during specific， times。

 you can close blackouts in the system， by giving it a shock， a big shock。 Then one year later。

 another group of researchers came in， and they showed that it's not as dark as it was shown。

 in the first paper。 Because the protection schemes， the underlying protection schemes。

 of the power grid， they can withstand against those attacks， to some extent。

 Now let's move to our paper， our presentation， and see what we have done。 To do so。

 let's talk about the threat model。 So we want to do the market manipulation in the electricity。

 market。 But how can we manipulate the prices？ If you remember this scene， this is a famous movie。

 called Wolf of Wall Street。 This guy， Jordan Belfort， was one of the biggest。

 cameras in the stock market of the US。 He used to manipulate the market prices and use the new。

 prices and manipulate the prices in his own favor。 For example。

 he was buying a stock in low price and then， selling the same stock after a huge manipulated pump in the stock。

 For example， he could buy a stock when the price was $2， and he could sell it when the price was $3。

 And also， he also used the concept of short selling。 Basically， he borrowed stock from the broker。

 He sold it at a high price。 Then he dumped the price and he bought， again。

 the same stock and give them back to the broker itself， with a lower price。

 So he could make money this way as well。 But can we do a similar thing in electricity market？

 By studying the data of the electricity markets， we noticed。

 that the system demand change in real time or the load。

 forecasting error can affect the electricity market prices。

 So if we can somehow control the total power consumption， of the power grid and change it slightly。

 we， should be able to affect the real time system electricity， market prices。

 So if that hacker has access to a high-wadded IoT botnet。

 we can manipulate the profits of different players。 And in this way。

 we can have two different attacker types。 Attacker type 1 is a market player whose goal is to maximize。

 his own profit。 And the second one is a nation state actor， which。

 is a part of trade or cold war to damage the other players， financially or the entire market。

 But that hacker needs market historical and real time data， to estimate the key parameters。

 such as the price load sensitivity， system real time demand， and day head prices。

 And one more key point is that the attacker needs。

 to optimize the attack to maximize the gain and damage， on the system。

 So we have two attacker types。 The optimization problems would be maximizing the profit。

 of the market player in the first attack type。 And the constraints are technical due to the market player。

 market rules， and the stealth strategies。 The second one is to maximize the economic damage。

 of the market， entire market， and the constraint， market rules and the stealth strategies。

 But let's talk about the feasibility of attack。 From the IoT botnet perspective。

 a successful attack， we noticed that it can be done with as low as 50，000 bots。 Of course。

 the more your bots you have， the more damage， or the more profit you can make from the market。

 But the lower number of bots doesn't jeopardize， the general structure of the attack。

 And also you can build and rent a decent botnet， such a botnet， with almost $4，000 per month。

 But this is even not comparable to the attack date。

 because you can gain millions of dollars per day， with such market manipulation。

 The key point is that your bots should be high wattage。

 But do we have such number of high wattage devices， for example， in the US？

 And this right-hand side figure shows， the total number of the smart thermostats。

 in the North America region。 And as we can see， there are over 30 million devices like this。

 in the North America region in 2020。 And this makes it feasible， because this is just。

 one of the devices available。 Device imagine that we have hundreds of such devices。

 in the environment。 And even if we are able to compromise less than 1%， of those devices。

 we should have a very， very big botnet。

![](img/add8eb43d6a17649f0721ce0b137c6d7_3.png)

 And also this table shows the available botnet rental， services。 And as you can see。

 there are a lot of services， for renting。 It's with different botnet size。

 with different rental costs， with different duration。

 But one thing to note here is that these are not necessarily， high wattage devices。

 So but we can actually extrapolate this table， to estimate the price of a high wattage device， even。

 if the price of renting a high wattage device is 10 times， 20 times bigger than this。

 even 100 times bigger than this。 It's still feasible to perform the attack。

 And we're expecting to see more high wattage devices。

 in the future after the publications of these recent， research works。

 From the power grid perspective， we， can see that these two figures show the day ahead。

 and real time market prices of the New York market。 As you can see， the day ahead prices。

 are lower than the real time prices。 In this specific hour-- and this is。

 because of the loads we're casting here that， happened at that time。

 From the end user's perspective， and the attacks， effect on the billing statement。

 by some technical analysis， we know that the average power consumption of American homes。

 is almost 900 kilowatt hour。 And if we assume that we have 100，000 bots each bot consuming。

 3 kilowatt of power， and we perform the attack 100 days， per year or eight days per month。

 not every day， and each device can be turned on or off for three hours on average， it's-- in fact。

 it's going to be 7% increase， in the billing statement in the most severe case on the attack。

 So it's almost unnoticeable。 So if you're paying $100 for your electricity bill。

 if you have a compromise bot in your house， you're going to pay $107， which is totally unnoticeable。

 But we need to sell strategies to guarantee， the repeatability of the attack。

 And this repeatability will increase the attack gain in general。

 And this increase in the attack gain， will add to the motivation of the attackers。

 and also the stealth would add to the motivation of the attackers。

 to avoid law related repercussions。 The first stealth strategy， we need。

 to hide the attack from the market operator。 So what can you change the demand of the system severely？

 Most likely， no， because the system operator， would easily notice there is something weird going on。

 This is another typical load profile in the system， and there is something weird going on。

 so it's probably an attack。 So what if we limit the attack and if we limit the demand。

 manipulation to a typical load forecasting error， similar， to what we have shown in this figure。

 it's almost unnoticeable。 So as a market operator， when I'm seeing one of these cares。

 here as a load real-time system load， and the black line shows the data head line。

 data at load forecasting line， we're， changing the system demand in the error band。

 So it's almost unnoticeable， and you， can't distinguish between the actual system change。

 or actual load forecasting error or any attacks。 The second strategy would be the frequency of the attack。

 You can't launch the attack every day， because you're recurring too much risk。

 and there's a high chance of being caught and detected。

 But if you launch the attack 100 days per year， it's reasonable because you're launching the attacks。

 eight days per month， and even if you are too conservative， you can reduce this number to 50。

 The other stealth strategy would be implementing the sub-optimal， attack scenarios。

 We can choose a sub-optimal attack vector。 This will make it harder for the market analyzer。

 to detect the attack， and he might find the other innocent， players guilty in this case。

 We can also deliberately target the other players。 In this case。

 the attacker might intentionally target， his competitors to damage certain companies and players。

 and this will lift the suspicion from himself， to the other companies。

 We should also manipulate the N-bots in a smart way。 For example。

 if you categorize different devices， and they're availability time， you， can change them smartly。

 For example， for the electric vehicle， which has been proven to have a great potential。

 you can change them during the midnight， period， they're connected to the charger。

 and the homeowner is， usually asleep。 But for the other devices， such as HVAC systems。

 you can change them and manipulate them when the homeowner is， not home。

 usually between 9 AM to 11 AM or 12 PM。 It's a good time to turn on or off those devices。

 Now let's talk about the numerical results。 For evaluation purposes， we didn't。

 implement this specific attack。 I anticipated practice because it has a huge financial effect。

 on the market and just avoid the law related repercussions。 But we use real world data analysis。

 for showing the effect of the attack， from the two biggest markets in the US， New York。

 and California markets。 We collected one year data from those markets， from their official website。

 because they're， sharing their real time information officially， from their website。

 and they're updating them。 And every five minutes， it's just crazy。

 The first step would be estimating， the key parameters based on the historical data。

 The first parameter is the price load sensitivity。 So we need to estimate that at every hour。

 if we change the price to a certain point， if we change the demand to a certain point。

 how much price is going to change？ By studying the historical data of the New York market。

 and California market， we noticed， that we obtained these two figures for the price load sensitivity。

 As you can see， it's different for different markets， but the trend is almost the same。

 but the numbers are a little bit different。 So you have to analyze the historical market。

 of each specific market to obtain this parameter。 It's different for each market。

 And also for estimating the error band and load forecasting， error band of different markets。

 we studied again， the historical data， and we obtained these two figures。

 The top figure is for the New York， and the bottom figure is for the California market。 OK。

 for the attacker type one， attacker is a market player， and a typical power plant owner， with 2。

000 megawatt capacity， we assumed that the market player has this specific characteristic。

 And we showed that for different botnet sizes， and for on average different power consumption in each bot。

 one represents 1 kilowatt， 2 kilowatt， 3 kilowatt， for average of the power consumption of each bot。

 And this is the size of the botnet。 As the size of the botnet increases。

 we have a bigger daily additional profit。 But for a typical botnet size， such as 100，000 bots。

 we can make almost 500， I'm sorry， $50，000 per day。

 or additional profit for this specific market player。 And at the same time。

 we're keeping the tax healthy， as you can see， for different attack gains。 We have。

 we're still within the error band， and the market operator cannot notice any unusual activity。

 from the load profile of the system。 For the attacker type 2， which is a nation state actor。

 he can do this based on， as a part of a trade or cold war。 And he wants to target the， let's say。

 generation side companies。 As you can see， in a typical botnet size of 100，000 bots。

 the attacker can make， in the New York market， he can make almost $2 million economic damage per day。

 that he launched at that。 So if he launched at that 100 days per year。

 it's going to be $100 million。 And again， the trend is very similar once you increase。

 the size of the botnet， the economic damage， would increase as well。 And also。

 if the average power consumption of each bot， increases， the attacking also increases as well。

 Again， the attack is stealthy。 We're changing the system demand in the error band。

 and the system operator cannot notice any change， in the system。 Finally， we have， again。

 the nation state actor。 But this time， instead of targeting the generation side。

 companies and players， he is targeting the demand side， companies or the retailers。 Again。

 with a typical botnet size of 100，000， 150，000， we have over 2 million economic damage。

 which can incur daily on the market players。 Again。

 we have the similar trend as the size of the botnet， increases。

 the gain of the attack increases as well。 And also， as the average power consumption of each bot。

 within the botnet increases， we have， the increase in the attack gain as well。

 But we talked about the attack effect， based on the real-world data information。

 But what about the countermeasures？ What we can do to prevent this attack。

 or even reduce the damaging consequences？ The first countermeasure that we propose in this presentation。

 is to develop a real-time IoT monitoring database。 So what is this concept？

 Let's say we convince the big vendors of the IoT， such as， high-wattage IoT developers。

 such as Honeywell， NEST， or General Electric， Schneider Electric。

 to register a portion of their devices in an online database。

 where we can monitor the real-time behavior of those devices。

 such as if they are being simultaneously turned on or turned， off。 And in this case。

 if there is any suspicious behavior， in a portion of those devices， we。

 can treat it as an anomaly or we can detect something， is going wrong。 For example。

 if we can only register 1% of the whole high-wattage。

 IoT devices and if we're seeing weird behaviors， and simultaneous behaviors in certain hours in just 1%。

 of those 1% devices， we can conclude， that there's something going wrong here。

 The other countermeasure would be revisited market data sharing。 And in this case。

 we're arguing that the data privacy， plans should be developed to not to share this real-time market。

 data with everyone in the public。 This will almost significantly reduce the risk-own nation。

 state attacker。 Even for the market players， we propose。

 to release the pre-processed and delayed version of the data， instead of the real-time version。

 And by implementing this specific countermeasure， we can see the attack game for the nation state。

 actor is significantly reduced here。 Again， the other countermeasure could be a policy-related thing。

 And it's limiting the price sensitivity in the real-time， market。 So in this case。

 we don't allow the price change from zero， or even negative to an astronomical value。 In this case。

 if you can limit the price， for example， to 20% the attack game here in this figure。

 we've shown that it reduces a lot。 Finally， as far as the conclusions and possible directions。

 an IoT botnet-based attack on the electricity market， was introduced in this presentation。

 And it was the first market manipulation， server attack that is available in the literature。

 Its effect was analyzed on two sample big electricity markets， in the US。

 California and New York markets。 As we've seen by our data analysis， you can close over $24 million。

 You can make over $24 million a further yearly profit， as a malicious market player。

 And even for the nation state actor， you can make-- you can close $350 million。

 economic damage on the market players。 Finally， we propose the setup practical countermeasures。

 to reduce the attacking and to reduce the damaging consequences， of the attack。

 And we hope to raise the attention of the market operators。

 that these unnecessary data sharing might be maliciously。

 used by different ways to attack the market。 But for the future work and possible direction。

 we think that further research and analysis， are required to develop more effective countermeasures。

 to defend against the IoT skimmer attack， and the similar attacks in this domain。

 Thank you for listening to our presentation。 And we're here for the questions。
