# Black Hat USA 2025 Keynote ｜ Mikko Hypponen ｜ Three Decades in Cybersecurity [H14EhT-DRJ8]

Please welcome to the stage， the founder of Black Ha， Jeff Moss。Yeahは。😊，Thank you。

 That wasn't intimidating at all。Nope， not at all， we are not rock stars。Anyway。Welcome。

 this is the 28th Black Ha USA。It's amazing some of us have。Lived our whole life and black hat。

 some of you were just starting your careers。And I want to thank everybody for coming here。

 Some of the things we do at Black Hat is we try to figure out how to bring new people into our community because it's an expensive you know。

 event and there's a lot of options。One of the things we do is we try to bring in students。

We have a scholarship program， so if you write an interesting paper， it gets reviewed。

You get to attend。 And what we're trying to do is we're trying to get new ideas。

 So anybody in the audience here that was a scholarship。Okay， raise your hand if you were。Right on。

 right there， front row， front and center。 She's going places。

👏So my advice to you if you're new is don't be afraid to ask questions。

 we're meant to be more Socratic， we want you to challenge what speakers are saying。

 because things in tech are not always black and white， things change。So。Normally。

 I have some opening remarks， and I'm going to kind of steer away from the tech a little bit。

 and it's going to be more around people。 And I think what's going on for me， at least is。

Who here feels like we're entered or're entering sort of like chaotic times， uncertain times。

 like who's feeling really like they understand what's going on。Like like nobody， right。

 it's pretty chaotic and I think。Honestly， we're at the beginning of this。

 We're not in the middle of it。 it's just starting to sink in。

 and it's because we have a lot of change occurring at the same time。We have。

 I have notes right here。嗯。We have a lot of disruption around AI。

 or we think we have a lot of disruption around AI because we don't quite know what it will fully disrupt yet。

You know，Inacting with some AI call assistances， I don't think is fully disrupted AI call assistance unless your metric is generating frustration in humans。

I think we have a period now we've entered a great power competition， and this isn't just US China。

 US， Russia， US Iran， it's in periods of great power competition。

 issues of national pride become very important。And issues of national pride aren't always what's 100% logical。

And to you， they might not look rational。But tenations through。Totally rational。

And so you have to adapt。We have normal。Competition， but we also have new regulations。

E U is starting to implement their CR， their Cyber Resiliency Act， imposing liability on software。

 This is something we've talked about for 2，3 decades in America。 They're actually doing it。

 and we don't know what it means。They don't know what it means。

But we're going to figure this out together。 And so you're going to have to keep that on your radar。

We have trade uncertainty。I'm just going to give you a quick little story， who here knows？

How every year at Dfcon， it's basically a shit show around getting the badges。Right。

Despite all of our planning。This year。To illustrate some of these points。We're manufacturing。

Our badges in Vietnam， there's a tsunami。Now the tsunami was not on the calendar。

 it just presented itself。So the factory flooded and it was offline for two days。No problem。

 we've got buffered， we've got time。The president announces that August 1 is the start of a new trade tariff。

Our costs will go up about 20%。Everybody's cost in that region will go up。

 So guess what happens All freight in Southeast Asia evaporates overnight。

You can't find a space to put a pallet on an airplane or a boat。

Two things happened at the same time right I got a tsunami and I got a new trade war thing that's the kind of chaos I'm talking about。

 I can handle one， two starts to get a little crazy， and I think that's going to be our norm。

And finally， I。There's a social component going on as well。 and the social component， I think， is。

If you're LGBTQ and you're maybe not feeling very appreciated here。You might look elsewhere。

You might want to change jobs， you might want to change cities。

 other countries see this as an opportunity。Australia， Japan， Singapore。

 the EU even has special visas if you're a professor trying to attract talent out of America。

 so there's a lot of churn socially right now。My sister is a professor in one state。

 and she's going to another state。 There's a lot of people reevaluating their social situation。

And finally， I want to。Point out that tech is now firmly。Unequivocally political。Like for the first。

 I don't know， two decades。We would sit here and say， yeah， but we're not political， text。

 not political， we zeros and ones， whatever， not our problem。

Now it's our problem because tech is in everything。I had to sign personally an 899 form for the DOD。

Saying that Deffcon does not use any  Huawei equipment。

If I want to have somebody from the DOD attend Efcon， I have to attest。

That I don't have  Huawei equipment。 right， That's just one bit of paperwork。

There's mountains of this stuff。ho do you buy from？Are you going to buy from Israel？

Are you going to buy， I don't know， technology from China？

Are your suppliers or vendors going to want you to。

 are your customers going to ask you these kinds of questions？

Just acquisitions alone are going to become political。

And you think AI is going to help you with that。AI is going to be like， well。

 I've read the papers and I understand the political trade offs on where we could acquire our technology no。

These are human decisions。These are personal decisions， and their decisions in。

Support of the business mission。Does the AI understand your business mission。No。

 how will it make an informed decision？ And so when I look at all this， I don't know， uncertainty。

 and I think to myself。What do I do， right， I've got kids。How do I position my kids？

To do well in this environment。 So you're like， okay， well。I want my kids to be adaptable。

 I want them to be flexible。 I want them to have options。

So that generally means you want them well educated， you want them to speak multiple languages。

 you want them to travel the world and not be afraid of other people， other food。

 you want them to feel comfortable moving around in different groups。If I can do that。

 that's probably success。So what's the equivalent of that in tech and in business。

 how do you become adaptable and resilient and flexible in business？And。

When I was advising Homeland Security。One of the components is FEMA。 And back then。

 when FEMA was doing a lot of work。We did studies on how do communities recover from natural disasters。

 there had been a big tornado or event in New Orleans， there's one in Florida while I was there。

And they found that the characteristics of communities。Were the most important。

 well connected community recovered faster， suffered less damage， required less support。

And so when you know who your neighbors are and you can rely on each other。You can recover faster。

 you're more resilient。ThereWe also did a study on countering violent extremism。

 how do you prevent Americans becoming foreign fighters in other countries and then coming back to America to cause trouble。

And it turns out。Building stronger communities。Prevents or reduces the number of people wanting to join foreign fights。

It also reduces the number of people joining gangs。

 It also reduces the number amount of crime in the community。

So building a strong community pays off in more than just one way， it pays off in multiple ways。

So how are you building a strong community in your company？Is your company， is your team resilient。

 how would you make it resilient？And so I I've got a couple of quotes I've written down here。

 I think because people， you know， we respond well to stories and we respond well to other people's kind of interesting quotes。

 The first one I was going to lead with was there's this Chinese proverb。

 may you live in interesting times， who's heard of that one， raise your hand。

And the thing there is the interesting is ironic， that's like actually a curse。

But it turns out that's not a Chinese proverb at all。 somebody made it up。

Will Chamberlain was writing to his son and his son mistranslated it。

 that's not it at all the closest Chinese proverb to that is it's better to be a sleeping dog in tranquil times than a human in chaotic times。

So where are all humans in chaotic times？Right now， and here's another quote for you。

 we're going to go to war with the army we have。Not the one we want or the one we wish we had。

You're going to engage in business。With your team you have now。And if you're lucky。

 you've got some time to build a better team， and how will you build that better team？

I don't believe you can buy the A team。 You're not going to buy the best。

Now you might be able to hire an a team individual contributor。But unless you're Sam Altman， I mean。

 Mark Zuckerberg， you're not going to be able to buy an entire A team division unless you've got billions of dollars。

So your options are really。Build the team。So you want to start with the C team and the B team。

Build the B team into the A team， stop telling yourself you need the best， you need a good team。

 you don't need the best individual contributor。And so。

I think one thing that the military or the federal government generally has done well。

Is they recognize that。A sense of mission is worth about at least half your salary。

I was talking to someone yesterday， they are running one of the largest healthcare providers。

 SiISO at one of the largest healthcare hospital chains in Canada。And he took almost。

He's making about one third the money he had he was making in the private sector， one third。

 he took a two third pay cut。Because of the mission。He can believe in that。Right。

If you don't have a mission， you better have a lot of fucking money。😡，Because。

People only respond to money up to a certain point。

So having a clear sense of what it is you do and why you do it and hopefully it makes people feel better about themselves。

 that's going to go a long way in helping you build your team。嗯。

So I'm on the board of this one company and our chairman。Constantly likes to say。

That culture eats strategy for breakfast。It doesn't matter how awesome your strategy is。

 it could have like flow charts and Venn diagrams and you know。

But if the culture of your company is not right。Strategy does not matter It's almost like。

Who heres had to live through like an SAP integration？Or an oracle integration。

 The joke is that your company。Does not integrate with Sap does not integrate with your company。

 Your company integrates with Sap。 Your culture changes to an Sap culture。

SAP does not adapt to yours， so it's that kind of a situation where you need to understand your corporate culture because that will limit your ability to create and execute strategy。

And don't go writing strategies that have no chance of surviving in your culture。

So I guess my closing thoughts are around。Be flexible。Have optionality。

The more options and adaptability you have。The more your employees have room to maneuver。

 they can operate right a problem comes up， oh that's okay we're not totally locked into this tech stack。

 we've got this backup tech stack， yeah， we're not 100% on Palo Alto we can roll back to something else right you need options in chaotic environment if you optimize for absolute efficiency。

 you're going to become brittle and when you're in a chaotic environment。Brittle can be death。

So you might have to give up some efficiency。Now， my final thoughts are now since you're at Black Ha。

 is when I started Black hat。There's always this tension between how technical you make the conference。

 how social。And I've always believed that a good event。Is 50，50， half technical content。

 half opportunities for you to meet other people， half social。Because。We're in this room in person。

 we're not on virtual。There is a reason why every year bandwidth is increased。

 video screen resolution has increased。And more people come to conferences。

 It's not because they wish they had telepresence。It's because they want to meet people and see them and ask them what's going on。

So that is the clear value of coming to a conference。

 meeting your peers and understand what's going on。Take time to do that。Ask people questions in line。

 like we're all wanting the same thing。So don't be afraid， don't be shy。Just participate。All right。

In my back pocket here。It is my opening notes for introducing our keynote speaker， Miko Hyponin。Now。

 I technically don't really need these， I've known Miko for probably over 25 years。嗯。

And he's probably one of the first Finnish people I've met。In tech。

 he's most famous probably for in 1991， he was the person that identified and tracked down the originator of the first and still to this date。

 the largest email worm ever， theI love you virus。And from there， it's just all down the rabbit hole。

 I think， for him。He's spoken everywhere， he's written books everywhere， he's really well published。

 and I don't just say that because I wrote the For for his last book， if it's smart， it's vulnerable。

 but the first chapter in his book， he got me hooked because he had a sob 9000 car。

 and my first car was a sob 900。He had me by an order of magnitude。

And so he's going to be sharing some pretty interesting insights and I just really look for it。

 He's a fantastic presenter， so it's really my privilege and honor to introduce Miko to the stage。

My name is M Con。I live in Helsinki。Which is in Finland， which is in Europe。In 1991。

When I was a 21 year old student。I joined a small startup as a programmer。Pretty quickly。

 I was reassigned from my programming duties to start to do rivers engineering。

With this new problem of computer viruses。MSSD viruses infecting IBMPCs and compatibles spreading around the world on floppy disks。

And for the younger people in the audience， this is a floppy disk。

This is what USB thumb drives used to look like in the 1990s。So I started analyzing viruses。

 and I collected every single virus in the world around 150 viruses at the time， I had a box。

 this box right here with 150 floppies， one virus on each floppy。

And I reverse engineered every single one of them。 So I had full expertise of the whole problem scenario。

 which would be very hard to do nowadays with millions and millions of malware we have today。But。

 of course， the problem was very， very different。These viruses we were fighting in the late 1980s。

 early 1990s were written by teenage boys and they would basically play pranks with the users。

 they would infect your computer， then after five days or after you've rebooted the computer1 hundred times or on specific dates。

 it would show you something， a message， an animation。

 it might place a music or randomly when you would try to run a program。

 you get a guy walking across your screen instead。So basically pranks written by teenage boys。

These boys。We're not benefiting in any way from these viruses they were writing， they made no money。

 they had no message， they didn't become famous。😡，The problem was very， very different。

From where we are today。But it was a problem despite the fact that these viruses were more like pranks。

 many of them were destructive， these were infecting corporate networks。

 causing very serious problems。 so companies needed solutions。 and we started building solutions。

 This is our antivirus program from 1993 which we built together with a company from Iceland and werere selling worldwide。

 an MSsdo antivirus program to detect and disinfect。Viruses spreading on floppy disks。

 or maybe viruses infecting program files that you could share on B，BS systems。 Internet。

 as we know it today， didn't yet exist。 The Web had not been invented yet。

 or it wasn't in mainstream use。And。Obviously， the platforms were very different and spreading speeds of viruses in malware were totally different from today。

Among the viruses I analyzed early in my career was brain， which was already before my time。

 this is from 1986， I studied in 1991， however。When brain turned 25。In 2011。

We had a meeting at the company。Talking about how we should do something。

 the first PC virus turns 25。 we should do something。

 and I floated the idea that what do you think if I try to go and find the guys who wrote the first PC virus and the reason why I floated the idea was that I remembered when I had analyzed brain in the beginning of my career。

 there was a hidden message inside the boot sector of every infected floppy infected by brain。

It never shows the message， but if you look at the boot sector， you'll find this text saying730。

 Nissanbch Alammic Btan Lajorre。And then two names， Bait and Amjat。This is an address。

So I took a camera guy with me， and went。To Lahore。

 This is me walking down the street of Nissanbque Alammicbel town， finding number 7，3，0。

 and then knocking on the door。Who opens the door， Buy thanamjad。25 years later。

 they were still there and we had a really interesting discussion about why they wrote the brain A virus in 1986 and how do they feel about it today。

 if you're interested in PC virus history， you'll find the full video from YouTube。And I don't have。

My original brain dot a floppy anymore。 The original floppy that I analyzed in the beginning of my career。

I don't have it。Because I gave it to Bait and Amjad。🎼Thank you very much for this interview。

 and I actually， I broke。🎼Brain with me。 I brought it home。 It's for you。 Thank you very much。Well。

 thank you。Now， today。We don't fight。Viruses anymore。 Viruses are no longer a thing。Yes。

 we do have malware， but we almost never nowadays find malware which would spread automatically。

 we don't find parasitic viruses or boot sector viruses or email worms or network worms。

 today's attacks are quite different like ransomware ransomware almost never replicates further there's some exceptions。

 but typically a company gets hacked， and then they manually the attackers manually do lateral movement and find servers and workstations and push the malware on these machines。

 It doesn't replicate automatically。😡，And the reason why this has changed。

Is that today the attackers want to make money。And if you want to make money。

 you don't want to create outbreaks of malware which get out of control and end up infecting millions of computers。

 bringing the case。To front page news。If you want to make money with malware and you' are on the front page of CNNN。

com， you failed like you don't want publicity。And many of these early viruses became massively large outbreaks。

 much， much bigger outbreaks than what the creators thought。So， in May 2000。

We were the first company in the world to receive a sample of I love You， I love you。

 which went on to become the single largest email ver outbreak in history。

You would receive this email worm through an email from someone you know。

And the email would be titled，I love You。And the attachment in the email was titled Love Letforyou。

txt。vbsS。VBS visual basic script。 So if you click on the attachment。

 now you just executed the attachment and now you will send the same email to everybody in your address book as you。

 so you will send a love letter to your neighbors， to your workmates。

 to your boss and they will click on it and it will spread further。I remember this case very well。

 We received the first sample in the morning，9，41。We spent the next 48 hours trying to。

Fight the outbreak， and ultimately failing。Because the virus went on to infect 200 million computers around the world。

And today at our offices in Helsinki， we actually remembered this outbreak with an art piece。

 We opened up。😊，An art museum last September， the Museum of Maware Art filled with modern art。

 inspired by malware and viruses and cyber attacks。 And this is。😊，An art piece called click for Love。

 created by Cusper Hillil Den and Hukoumpinin， made out of computer Mos。

 painted pink to create a heart， because of course you used your mouse to click on the attachment。

 the love letter。But not all of these。Viruses were spreading over email。Around the same time。

 we started finding network worms， worms like Blaer， Slammer， Sassar， Nimda。

Blastster would infect Windows computers by scanning。IP addresses to find open ports。

I was looking for port 135 TCP， the RPC port。And this is 2003。

 So most users would be running Windows X P。 The latest version of Windows XP at the time was Windows X P service back1。

Windows XP service back 1 had a firewall， but by default， it was off。Just think about that。

 All Windows users on the planet by default， were exposing all their open ports to anybody on the Internet。

 That's hard to imagine nowadays。 a lot of things have changed over these decades as we've been getting better and better in computer security。

And blast，ster was a。Amazing wake up call because it was the first which really started hitting infrastructure。

 shutting down flights。Shutting down train traffic。

Infecting government networks and these early network warms worms even caused the US nuclear Regulatory Commission to put out a warning after this sor worm infected internal networks of a nuclear power plant。

😡，And we were in the middle of all of this。Collecting samples， rivers， engineering them。

 naming viruses， building detection， writing descriptions。Trying to protect our users。

 Here's what our lab looked like in 2004。 At the time， we only had one lab that was in Helsinki。

 Finland， which means that if there was an outbreak in the middle of the night。

 we worked in the middle of the night。Exciting times， also。Very tiresome work。 I mean。

 it's kind of exciting when you get woken up in the middle of the night and you find a sample and you block the attack。

 You feel like you save the world。 But then when it repeats two days later and then two days later。😊。

We quickly realized we have to change the way we work and started to open up labs around the world。

 So we wouldn't need to work in the middle of the night。And then we started seeing malware。

On things which were not computers。Phones。Around 2005， we found Cabiir and then Com Warri。

 These were early mobile phone viruses infecting Sbian phones。 Sbian was the operating system。

 which was the most common operating system before Android and iPhone or iOS。

running typically on Nokia phones。Here's in this video。

 you can see the combvo virus jumping from one infected phone to every other phone。

 which is close enough During the Bluetooth range， you get infected。Sounds。

Pretty bad so we started building RF labs or farraday cages where we could safely analyze these wireless viruses。

 we could infect handsets and test them without running the risk of the virus escaping because you could imagine someone visiting our offices with a mobile phone in their pocket while we were doing testing and it would just escape so we had to test them in a safe environment。

Now， this is still the time before smartphones。Phones became smartphones。Just like our。

TVs became smart Ts。Cars became smart， phones became smart， or watches。Became smart。

 cities became smart。Around 10 years ago， I was doing a talk somewhere。 and I just mentioned that。

 know， if it's smart。It's vulnerable。And that' stuck， It's now now on Wikipedia as the Hupan law。

 which is a very pessimistic law， but it's also true when we take everyday devices and we add functionality and connectivity。

 they become smart， but I also become hackable。Here's my watch。This is my Oomega C master。

 I've been carrying it for 24 years because I got it after a 10 year service at the company。

How do you hack my watch？A mechanical watch。Well， you don't。There's nothing to hack here。

There's no chipets。 There's no CPU。 There's no wfi。 There's no Bluetooth。

 Many of you have a smart watch in your wrist， maybe an Apple watch。

 maybe an Android watch or Soto or Garmin。Many of them are very， very safe。But not unhackable。

 I mean， they run code， code written by people。 people make mistakes。 When coders make mistakes。

 we end up with bugs。 When we have bugs in connected systems， they easily become vulnerabilities。

 which can be exploited。So when we add connectivity and functionality to devices， they become smart。

 but they also do become vulnerable。Now， in my history of working in cybersecurity。

 I think that year 2003 is the biggest shift we saw。Because before 2003。

There were still hobbyists and pranks。 A aroundund 2003。

 we started seeing the first money making Maloware。First， to help spammers to build spam bonets。

 then banking Trojans， thin keyloggers to collect credit card numbers。

And then eventually ran somewhere。 So money entered a picture in 2003 during the same year。

We found the first case that we were able to track down to a government。

 so governments started using offensive cyberpower in 2003 as well。For spying， for espionage。

 initially the typical case would be that a target working for a ministry or for a defense contractor would receive an email spoof to look like it's coming from someone they know and trust with an attachment like a PDF a word document or an Excel spreadsheet like this one right here。

😡，Which then contains an exploit when you open it， take over your computer and start to steal the secrets。

😡，And once the gates were open。For governments to use offensive cyberpower。

 we started seeing more and more of these from various different governments。 Initially， China。

 then Russia， eventually。The United States。Stocksni。2010， another seminal moment in history。

When United States， together with Israel rights， malware targeting the nuclear enrichment systems of the Natanch research facility inside Iran。

 delaying the Iranian nuclear program considerably with software。

Stocknet has been discussed in different venues。 There's great books。Written about it。

 but I also want to send a shout out to a great new project called where Warlocks Stay Up late。

The YouTube video series， created by Nathan Sportsman。

There's an upcoming episode which speaks about stocknet in length。So check that out。When ransom were。

Started to become the problem It is today。 We started seeing that many of the ransom were gangs。

Really paid attention to their brand。They wanted their victims to know that if you pay the ransom。

 they will deliver。So they created names and logos and brands for themselves and。

Took care of delivering the goods。 If you got infected。

 if your company was hit by ransomware and you paid the ransom。They would unlock your files。

 They wouldn't leak the files they stole。 They wouldn't attack you again。However。In 2017。

 we saw onena cry and then a month later， notpeya， the two largest ransomware cases in history。

 neither of which delivered the goods， even if you paid the ransom， you didn't get your filess back。

These two cases destroyed the reputation these ransomware gangs were trying to build for years。

 And the reason why Wanna cry and Not Peya were different。

Was that they were not written by criminals。They were both written by governments。

North Korea wrote one a cry。Wna crime was a ransomware written by a government trying to collect bitins from victims in order to fix their budget deficit。

😡，which sounds insane， but that's exactly what happened with Wakri to make it more insane。

 Wakri was spreading automatically， so this was a worm， a ransomware combined with a worm。

 and it was spreading using an SMB exploit eternal blue， which was developed。😡。

But United States government then stolen from the National Security Agency sold online。

Look at the prices， 750 bitcos， but that was 2017。And then it ended up in the hands of North Korean government。

 which used it to attack targets right here in America with an exploit written by US government。

How do we know it was North Korea？ Well， the code similarities are pretty obvious。

 linking Wanakra back。Do the swift banking attacks done by North Korea a couple of years earlier and to the Sony Pictures attack of 2014。

 where North Korea attacked Sony pictures because Sony was putting out a movie。

 a comedy movie laughing at Kim Yong Uun， the dictator of North Korea。

 and they retaliated by hacking the film studio。😊，A month later。Not petia。

 This one written by the government of Russia。Not Peya looks like ransomware。

 but it's not ransomware。 It's actually a cyber weapon。

 a weapon designed to hit one country only Ukraine。

But it escaped the theater of the war and started hitting targets in the West companies in Europe。

 in North America， in Asia。One of the most famous incidents was the mask shipping company。

 which ran into huge trouble。They had an office inside Ukraine which got infected。

 And then through their internal network， it hit targets elsewhere。

 Let me play you a video clip from interviewing the chairman of Marsk。

That meant that we were actually collateral damage of a probably state attack situation so and。

The impact of that was that we basically found that we had to reinstall an entire infrastructure。

WeWe had to install a 4，000 new service， 45，000 O PCs and 2 and5000 applications。Reinstall 45000。

Laptops and desktops。Now， I know Andy， who was the Cecaw at Marska at the time。

 and he told me about how hard it was to react when this actually happened。 it's the same story。

I've heard many times from。CSOs and COs who are in the middle of something like this。

 everything falls apart around you， none of your tools work， your computers are crashing。

 you can't communicate with your teams because your systems are down。😡。

It doesn't really matter how much you train and do tabletop exercises when suddenly your team is in a state of shock。

It's hard to work when you're in a state of shock。People get surprised。

And they are in a state of shock。

![](img/4faa41258c72c09a0d6d7f1fe2c0a60a_1.png)

You get my point。Now， they that surprise and multiply it with 1000。

 then imagine trying to run a recovery project。 The most important thing you're supposed to do in your career。

 like your company has been hit。 It's up to you to recover the company and you are your team are in a state of shock。

 That's hard。To rehearse for。And we don't have to go to faraway countries to find examples of this happening just two years ago right here in Las Vegas。

 the Alpha Rasomware gang hit the MGM Grand and related hotels that's the front page of the website of MGM Grand if you were walking through the casinos they would have these signs everywhere about computer problems and the casino equipment was just showing blue screens left and right。

 you can imagine how expensive something like this is。

And the reason why ransomware attacks like these have become such a big problem is。Bitcoin。

Money has become data。Cryptocurrencies are programmable money。

This is money based on math instead of money， based on politics。And when money is based on math。

 it's very hard to regulate it with regulations or laws because math doesn't care about your laws。

This is the reason why criminals。😡，B cryptocurrencies。Yes， there's other uses as well。

 but just like real world criminals love cash， online criminals， love cryptocurrencies。

 and the first time I heard about Bitcoin。Was in 2011。The Bitcoin White Paper came out in 2009。

Not much happened for the first two years， but in 2011， we found a piece of malware。

 which was already mining for bitcoins on infected computers。

 created a bonet of all the computers it infected， and it was using the CPU of the computers to mine for bits。

 which you could still do at the time。And all cryptocurrencies have。

An automatic buck bounty built into them。 like if you can hack the system， well， you get the rewards。

 they don't really have to need。 They don't need to have an official buck bounty because there is one built in right there。

And these early mining malware， like Sil Minr， would do exactly that they would infect people's computers and use the power of the computer to do the mining。

Today， you can't mine for Bitcoin on consumer PCs， but with some other cryptocurrencies。

 you can still do that。But the real big shift in cyber crime was really。

The beginning of ransomware using Bitcoin for payment mechanisms。

 This is the very first one to do it。 This is crypto locker of 2013。Today。

 there's an unlimited amount of gangs making millions with ransomware。

 I've started calling these gangs cybercrime Uniicors。Just like we speak about tech startups。

Wwhich are valued at a billion dollars that it's a unicorn company， well。

 if you look at the revenue of some of these ransomware gangs。

 if you look at the wealth they control， if you look at their profits， if these would be companies。

 they would absolutely be categorized as startup unicorns。Now， of course。

Ransomware gangs will never do an IPO。 So they're not real unicorns。

 but it's a good way of thinking about。Just how powerful they've become。And yes， they do branding。

 they have names， they have logos， they have websites。And I often。

Show the websites of ransomware gangs when I'm speaking with leadership teams or board members about the likelihood of your company getting hit。

By ransomware， because nobody believes they will be the next one。

So what I do is that I just pull out my computer， open up a tour browser。

 let's go to the website of Lopit， you can see the Onion address there in the top row right there if you want to visit it by yourself。

😡，Don't go with your work laptop， by the way， but that's the address。

And then well look at other victims， which companies have been hacked recently by a ransomware gang。

 and we have companies from Spain， from Monteteso， Ca， from Vegas， Argentina， Colombia， Uruguay。

 Brazil， Mexico， Iceland。Companies of all sizes， companies from all fields。Small companies。

 large companies， enterprises。Everywhere around the world， public companies， private companies。

 public sector， medical， anything。 And then when you scroll the list， you realize。

That the list never ends。It never ends hundreds and hundred thousands of victims from everywhere around the world。

 which pretty easily then opens up the eyes that if these companies were hit。

 then may be our company。😡，Can be hit as well。 And the reason why it looks so random。

Is that it is random。 These attackers， they don't typically choose that Let's go and hit companies in Canada today。

 or let's hit companies in Germany today， or let's hit steel mills， or let's hit banking sector。

 That's not the way they work。 They have a vulnerability。

They work with initial access brokers who have a way in。 Theres a weakness in this VP and server。

 If you haven't patched it in a year， we can get in。

 then they just scan the whole Internet to find all vulnerable servers。

And you end up with a list like this。 That's why it looks like somebody would have shot at the Internet with a shotgun。

Heating random targets。And these companies or。Criminal gangs。They cooperated with each other。

 I'll play you a one minute long promotion video。😊，From one of these ransomware gangs。

 this is from a gang called Gbo。

Pretty neat huh？This is not an endorsement。And I paused the video here to highlight the fact that yes。

 they are using AI already， of course they are， AI power negotiation support to handle most of the discussion between the attackers and the victims。

 of course attackers use AI， just like we use AI to defend against attacks。

And the reason why these gangs are able to do everything they do is。The money。

 the money is very good。And， we can。Tell that the money is good by looking at some of the guys who have been caught。

 So last September， a guy called Malone Lamb was arrested。And of course。

 he had the mandatory Lamau complete with his name。

 but when you look at the list of deceased cars seized by the authorities。

 it's actually pretty impressive， several Laboos， several Ferraris。

 Rossroys and the guarddamn Paganni。So maybe the best thing we can do is to focus on catching more of these guys。

 And that's why I like the rewards for Justice program。

 offering cash prices for information leading to the arrest of some of the largest ransomware gangs in the world。

 because these programs start to eat these gangs from the inside。

And that's exactly what we want to happen。 And we do have the occasional success stories， like here。

One of the Q ransomware affiliates getting arrested with law enforcement entering his home。

 carrying a master key， a key which opens every door。Did you see the key， looks like this？

Works like this。And catching online criminals and putting them behind the bars not only takes that particular problem away。

 but it also shows to potential newcomers in the field that crime doesn't pay， not even online crime。

But overall。I would claim that today。Security is better than ever。And I know what it sounds like。

Because it doesn't feel like it， doesn' it。It doesn't feel like it because every other day we read about yet another data breach。

 yet another data leak， yet another ransomware incident。

But if you just step back and think about where we've been。AndWhere we are today。

 It's like night and day。10 years ago。Just 10 years ago。

 the most common problem for your company would have been that users surf their web。

 click on links and get infected just by clicking on links。

That was the time of exploit kits like black hole。 And the reason why you could get infected just by clicking on a link was that。

You were running Java and flash plugins in inside of your browsers， which were easily exploitable。

 We've done so much。😊，In removing plugins and extensions。

 improving browser security and improving operating system security。😡。

And maybe the best example of this。Is maybe a bit surprisingly。Xbox。

I learned early in my career that if attacker gets physical access。

 if the attacker is on the keyboard of the computer， they want to hack， it's game over。

 if they have physical access， they can do anything， they can open up the computer。

 take out the chips， replace the chips， remove the hard drive。Well， that's no longer true。Xbox 1。

Has been out for 12 years。There's no jail break for Xbox1。 It's a Windows computer。

But nobody's figured out a way to run your own programs on this Windows computer。

 despite the fact that they have the computer， they own the computer， they have it in their hands。

 They can do anything they want。 Nobody's figured out how to do it。😡。

Why am I speaking about game consoles， Because this is an Xbox。

The phone in your pocket is essentially the same thing。It's a computer which is locked down。

Restrictive。You can't run arbitrary programs on it。

 Maybe the biggest single improvement in computer security over the last 15 years has been the introduction of these more restrictive operating systems like I and Android。

AndChromebook things like that。And I know some of you are thinking that， how can I praise？

Security of iPhone。 when at the same time， we know that it can be hacked。

 It has been hacked with things like pegasus。Which is true。However， Peccaus。

You can't just download Teasseus。It's a commercial program sold only to intelligence agencies。

 Criminals don't have it。 Only intelligence agencies have it。

 And the price for Pegasus is something like $100000 per victim。 And I'm sorry to tell to you。

 but you are not worth 100000。Very few of us are， you know， politicians， Cos， Ministers。

 that kind of things。 That's who are targeted with these。 And if it costs。100000 to hack your phone。

 That's not a security failure。 That's a security successy story。If it costs 100，000 to do it。

 that's a successy story。And all this means that attackers are finding。Easier ways in。

If it's hard to overcome the technical restrictions， then they go through the users。

 scammming the user， fooling the user， phishing the user。Now I'm not blaming the user here。

 I sort of hate the phrase that user is the weakest link， that's almost too easy to say。

 like if there's a link that the user must never click。

 why is the link on the user's computer to begin with。

 we really should stop putting responsibility on end users who can't handle the responsibility and put the responsibility to where it belongs。

😡，And the responsibility for cybersecurity really belongs to the people in this room。

 It belongs to you and me。Instead of blaming the user， we should take the responsibility that we。

 cybersecurity people really should be carrying instead。So it's quite clear。

That scams will get worse in the future。 It's also quite clear that ransomware。

He's only getting started。 We've now seen the first decade。Of corporate ransomware attacks。

 That's only the first decade。 It will continue。 It will get worse。

 As long as there's millions and millions that are being made， there will be more gangs。

 more attackers。And I do believe that AI is the key。

Because that's one of the few fields where defenders are ahead of the attackers。

All the cybersecurity companies here will tell you how extensively they use generative AI in their products。

Yes， attackers are using AI as well， but they're only beginning。

 We've only seen fairly simple attacks。We they are so far。It will change， but right now。

 I would claim we are ahead。And the challenge we face as cybersecur people is that our work is invisible。

When you do your job perfectly。The end result is that nothing happens。When you do your job，100%。

 when you prevent all the attacks。It only means nothing happened。

And people don't see when nothing happens。 I often call this cybersecurity Tetriris。

 because we all know the rules of Tetriris。 What you're trying to do in Tetriris is to make a whole line。

 And when you make a whole line， what happens， it disappears。

So your successes disappear while your failures pile up。 That's what happens in Te。

 That's what happens in cybersecurity。 And rarely， is anyone thanked。For stopping a disaster。

That didn't happen。Or in other words， let me quote， Ken Kier， when you do things right。

People won't be sure you've done anything at all。And every technological revolution we've seen。

Brings us benefits。😡，And problems。No matter how much we'd love to get just the benefits。

 we will get the problems as well。We've seen it with the revolution of connectivity， with mobility。

With smartphones， with social media。 And now we are seeing it。With artificial intelligence。AI is。

The biggest technological revolution I've seen in my life。Over the last two years。

A couple dozen zero days have now been discovered。By large language models， zero days。In 2024。

 there were 0，0 days discovered by large language models。 Now theres。I'm already losing count。

 a couple of dozen of these。All of the ones we know of have been found by researchers。

 which is great when researchers find security vulnerabilities with AI。

 that's great because then we can fix them。 When attackers do the same， That's awful。😊。

That's going to happen as well。So in 1991， when I joined。Data fellows。

The company where I work for many， many years。I didn't really see。How the world would change。

 if somebody would have told me in the beginning of my career that eventually I won't be fighting teenage boys riding boots sectorctor viruses。

 but that we would be fighting。Organized online crime gangs。

 making millions or fighting foreign militaries or intelligence agencies。

I wouldn't have believed that that would have sounded like science fiction。

But that's where we are today。Data fellows， eventually。

Migrated and split into two companies that still exist today。 if secure and with secure。

 I work today on the W secure side。But this is my last week。I resigned。In May。

 my notice period ends next Tuesday。Next Thursday。I'm switching industries。

I'm joining a defense contractor called Senor fusion， which builds drone defense systems。

 So I'm going from antivirus。Into antid。Why？Well， I live。Two hours away from the Russian border。

There's a war。Dead center of Europe right now。 war。

 which looks different from any of the wars we've ever seen before。War。

 which is extensively moving in the direction of UAVs and not just flying drones。

 but also marine drones。And the ground drones。And there's a lot of similarities here。

 I've been fighting promable threats all my life。Threats， which are trying to avoid detection。

 and we're trying to detect them。Threats， which will change behavior to avoid detection。

 And then we have to update our detection。 That's exactly what I've been doing in cybersecurity。

 And that's exactly the same scenario in drone defense。

And I've always thought that there's a lot of meaning for me。To work in cybersecurity。

 But I also believe。That for me。Right now， there's more meaning in antid。

 And that's why I'm making the shift because the face of conflict and the face of war is changing right now。

And I will be doing what I can in this new field。And that means。It's time for thank yous。哎呀。

I've been working all my life。In cybersecurity， and I will continue to be。

Involved in cyber in the future as well， I will still do talks。If people want to hear them。

 but I will no longer be working in the cybersecurity industry。So thank you。 I am here。

Because of you。I am here。Because of you， thank you。For giving me a home。For 34 years。

Thank you very much。 Thank you for your work。Thank you。Fantastic。All right。

 before I let everybody go， I've got some housekeeping notes。Briefings start at 1020。

The business hall is now open， it's on level1 in the Bayside rooms， A， B，C and D。

 business hall is open。We have main stage presentations。

 afternoon keynotes starting at 1215 in the oceanside A on level2。Tonight， 5 pm。

 we have the reception in the business hall。That's for your social。

 and we'll also see you here tomorrow， same time， same channel。

And I'll introduce Nicole Pearl Roth as our day two keynote speaker， so thank you very much。

 everyone。
